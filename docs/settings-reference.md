# Settings reference

The settings page (the pause menu's Settings) shows each row with a short note: what it does,
in one or two sentences [design: #2377, docs/design/settings-page.md §10]. This page keeps
the rest: for each row, by its INI key (`[Settings]` of `NVForever.ini`), where the page shows
it (tab and heading), its label, the note the page shows, the longer explanation the note
had before #2377 where it said more, and the command-line switches whose state the row
replaces (a test run that gives one keeps the command line's state over the INI's,
docs/design/settings-page.md §1). Rows are listed in the page's order
(`engine/nvf-play/src/settings_layout.rs`, `SECTIONS`). The words are NVForever's own; the
facts are the rows' (each row's module, named under its key). A row whose module is not part
of a run (lip sync without lip data, the draw distances, the quality presets without the
install's preset files) is not on the page then.

The Controls tab's own rows (Input Device, the controls, Invert Y, the sensitivities, Rumble)
are at the end.

## Graphics › Quality

### `quality`: Quality preset

- On the page: Sets the rows the original's quality presets cover to the game folder's
  low.ini to VeryHigh.ini. Custom: those rows match none of them.
- In full: Sets the rows the original's quality presets cover to the values of the game
  folder's low.ini, medium.ini, high.ini or VeryHigh.ini: Sun shadows, Shadow filtering,
  Light glow, Mirrored water reflections and the object, actor, item, shadow and grass
  distances. Custom: those rows match none of them. A preset whose file is missing is not
  offered. The enhanced effects, anti-aliasing and FSR keep their own rows.

## Graphics › Picture

### `enhanced`: Enhanced effects

- On the page: Sets every effect of the enhanced look at once. On: all of them. Off: none,
  the original's picture. Custom: some on, some off. Each keeps its own row.
- In full: On: every effect of the enhanced look (ambient occlusion, longer sun shadows,
  bloom, sharpening, anisotropic filtering 16x, sun shafts, screen-space water reflections).
  Off: none of them, the original's picture. Custom: some on, some off. Each effect keeps
  its own row and its own saved state; this row only sets them all at once.
- More: docs/design/graphics-enhanced.md
- Registered in `engine/nvforever/src/quality.rs`

### `grade`: Colour grade

- On the page: On: the picture is graded by the worldspace's, the weather's and the cell's
  image space. Off: the picture as lit, for comparisons.
- Command-line switches: `--no-grade`
- Registered in `engine/nvforever/src/settings.rs`

### `sun-shadows`: Sun shadows

- On the page: The sun's shadows: Off, Performance (cheaper outdoors; moving shadows update
  at half the frame rate) or Quality. The original casts none from the world.
- In full: The sun's shadows, out to --shadow-distance: Off; Performance (the shadow maps
  drawn every other frame in two cascades, trees casting shadows only near you, the
  first-person arms taking the world's shadows: saves frame time outdoors, shadows of moving
  things update at half the frame rate); or Quality (three cascades, the farther ones drawn
  less often). The original casts none from the world. Quality by default in the game.
- Command-line switches: `--shadow-distance`, `--sun-shadows`, `--no-sun-shadows`
- Registered in `engine/nvforever/src/settings.rs`

### `upscaler`: Upscaler

- On the page: FSR 3.1 or NVIDIA DLSS rebuilds the world at display resolution, at the mode
  below. DLSS needs an NVIDIA RTX card and its files in the dlss folder.
- In full: Reconstruct the world at display resolution with FSR 3.1 or NVIDIA DLSS, at the
  Upscaling mode below. Disables MSAA, FXAA, SMAA and TAA while active. Menus stay sharp.
  Requires Vulkan; unsupported devices keep native rendering. DLSS needs an NVIDIA RTX
  graphics card and NVIDIA's DLSS files in the dlss folder beside nvforever.exe (NVForever
  ships none). With the files there when the game starts, every choice takes effect at once;
  files put there later are found at the next start, so DLSS chosen until then reads DLSS
  (restart) (loading a save starts the game again). Sharpening controls FSR sharpening.
  Frame generation needs an upscaler.

### `upscaler-quality`: Upscaling mode

- On the page: The share of the screen the world is drawn at; the upscaler rebuilds the
  rest. Native AA: full size. Quality to Ultra Performance: ever faster.
- In full: The share of the screen's width and height the world is drawn at; the upscaler
  rebuilds the rest. Native AA: full resolution, anti-aliasing only (DLSS: DLAA). Quality:
  the sharpest upscaled look, for 1440p and 4K. Balanced: more speed with little visible
  loss. Performance: the highest frame rate, for 4K or heavy scenes. Ultra Performance: for
  very high resolutions only. Takes effect at once. With Upscaler Off there is nothing to
  set.

  recommended: NVIDIA picks per mode. Only while DLSS draws.
- In full: Which of NVIDIA's DLSS models rebuilds the picture (NVIDIA calls them presets).
  Default (recommended): NVIDIA picks per mode: K for Native AA, Quality and Balanced, M for
  Performance, L for Ultra Performance. K: transformer model, best detail, costs more. L:
  sharper and steadier, less ghosting, costs the most. M: close to L in looks, closer to K
  in speed. J: like K with a little less ghosting and more flicker. Takes effect at once.
  Only while DLSS draws.

### `fsr-library`: FSR library

- On the page: What FSR upscales with: NVForever's built-in FSR 3.1, or a FidelityFX library
  in the game's folder (for tools that replace the upscaler).
- In full: What FSR upscales with: NVForever's built-in FSR 3.1, or a FidelityFX library in
  the game's folder (amd_fidelityfx_loader_vk.dll or amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll; not part of
  NVForever), which tools that replace the upscaler use. The choice names the library found;
  with none there the built-in FSR runs.

### `frame-generation`: Frame generation

- On the page: Frames made between the real ones: smoother motion, input a little later. FSR
  3.1 needs FSR upscaling; DLSS an RTX 40 or newer. Not in the original.
- In full: Frames made between the real ones, so motion looks smoother; what you do reaches
  the screen a little later. FSR 3.1: one frame between each two real frames; needs FSR 3.1
  upscaling (any mode; not with DLSS) and vertical sync or variable refresh, and real frames
  are held to just under half the refresh rate. DLSS: NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, one to
  three frames for each real frame (Generated frames, below); needs an upscaler (FSR 3.1 or
  DLSS), Display sync Off, an NVIDIA RTX 40 series or newer graphics card, Windows'
  hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling and NVIDIA's frame generation files in the dlss folder
  beside nvforever.exe; frames are generated only while the game's window is in front.
  Latency reduction turns on with either. The HUD and menus are not generated; menus and
  loading screens show real frames only. Best from 60 real frames a second. Not in the
  original.

### `frame-generation-frames`: Generated frames

- On the page: How many frames DLSS frame generation makes per real frame: 2x one, 3x two,
  4x three (3x and 4x on RTX 50 series). Not in the original.
- In full: How many frames DLSS frame generation makes for each real frame: 2x one, 3x two,
  4x three. More looks smoother and costs a little more latency and graphics memory; 3x and
  4x only where the graphics card offers them (RTX 50 series). Takes effect at once. Only
  with DLSS frame generation. Not in the original.

### `anti-aliasing`: Anti-aliasing

- On the page: How edges are smoothed: multisampling 2x, 4x or 8x (dearer at each step) or
  FXAA, SMAA or TAA afterwards. Reads Off while an upscaler is on.
- In full: How edges are smoothed: multisampling Off, 2x, 4x or 8x (--msaa; the cut-out
  edges of plants too), or the picture smoothed afterwards: FXAA (cheapest, softest), SMAA
  (sharper, a little dearer) or TAA (over the frames; plants too, soft while moving;
  --graphics-only fxaa, smaa or taa). Multisampling is the dearest, more at each step: at
  1920x1080 on an RTX 4070, 2x added about 0.8 ms a frame, 4x about 1.3 ms and 8x about 2.3
  ms (Goodsprings and Novac at noon); FXAA, SMAA and TAA cost less than 4x. Where the
  processor sets the pace (the Strip at night) the choice costs next to nothing. While an
  upscaler (FSR 3.1 or DLSS) is on it does the anti-aliasing itself, so this row reads Off
  (upscaling active); your choice comes back when Upscaler is Off.
