# Perk audit (2026-10-23)

Every PERK record of the ten masters checked against what NVForever evaluates. Asked by the
owner: "check for gaps in our code for handling all the perks … confirm and we'll build the
functionality". This note is the confirmation; §4 is the proposed build order.

## 1. Sources and method

In order of trust (owner's rule: the fandom wiki only where nothing better says otherwise):

1. **The game's records** [observed]: every PERK of FalloutNV.esm, the four story add-ons,
   Gun Runners' Arsenal and the four packs, read with a private script: each effect's kind
   (entry point, ability, quest stage), entry point code, function, value and condition
   tabs; each ability's magic effects and archetypes; every script (SCRO) and condition
   (HasPerk) that names the perk; the GMSTs of the VATS helpers. 257 PERK records: 90
   playable perks and 10 traits in FalloutNV.esm, 32 playable perks and 6 traits in the
   add-ons, and 119 others (challenge rewards, companion perks, implants, add-on rewards).
2. **The GECK wiki** [documented]: GetNthPerkEntryFunction, "Entry Function Codes" (the 74
   entry point codes and names); Entry Point (what each one changes and when it runs).
3. **The fandom wiki** (Fallout: New Vegas perks page, saved in
   `C:\fnv-private\geckwiki`) for player-facing descriptions only. Every perk it lists is a
   PERK record above, except the companions' upgrades Faithful Protector, Blood of the Legion,
   Unshakeable Tracker (Rex) and Ravenous Hunger (Dog), which are not PERK records
   [observed: no PERK has those names]. Nothing in it contradicted the records.

What NVForever evaluates [observed: the code at origin/main 2fafe678]: entry points 0, 1, 2,
6, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 25, 27 (Activate choices), 29, 34, 36, 40, 44, 56, 57, 58 and 68
(`fnv_game::perks`, `activate_choices.rs`, `magic_archetypes.rs`, `nvf-play` `combat.rs`);
abilities of every archetype the masters' perk abilities use (value modifier and script
effects, conditions rechecked: levelup.md §9); quest-stage effects; HasPerk in conditions
and scripts. Script functions are all built but 6 stubs (`tools/smoke/expected/script-stubs.toml`),
so perks that act through scripts are taken as working; none of them was played through.

A perk is **missing** when every effect it has is an entry point NVForever never asks for,
**partly** when some are.

## 2. Totals

| NVForever | Records |
|---|---|
| Works (entry points evaluated, abilities, quest stages) | 160 |
| Works through scripts or conditions only (Wild Wasteland, Terrifying Presence, Nuka Chemist, Retention, add-on rewards …) | 29 |
| **Missing** | 44 |
| **Partly** | 9 |
| Its only gap is VATS's hit chance, which VATS mode does not have (§3.9) | 10 |
| No effect in the records (Deathclaw Omelet, Spicy Casserole, Brain-full, Heart-full, Spine-full: markers) | 5 |

The appendix lists all 257.

## 3. What is missing, by the system it needs

Values are the records' [observed]; what the entry point changes is the GECK wiki's Entry
Point page [documented] unless tagged.

### 3.1 VATS helpers and VATS mode's AP (the owner's example; built 2026-10-24, vats-mode.md §18)

| Perk | Entry point | Record |
|---|---|---|
| Mysterious Stranger (lvl 10) | 28 Mysterious Stranger: "run when the player enters VATS; if non-zero the VATS helper Mysterious Stranger may appear" | Set 1 |
| Miss Fortune (lvl 10) | 41 Miss Fortune: the same for Miss Fortune | Set 1 |
| Friendly Help (challenge reward: 15 helper visits) | 67 VATS Helper Chance: "modifies the chance of a VATS helper" | Multiply 2 |
| Grim Reaper's Sprint (lvl 20) | 35 Player Kill AP Reward: "run when VATS finishes if the player killed at least one enemy; modifies the AP reward from 0" | Add 20 |
| Nerves of Steel (lvl 26), Atomic! (×1.1–1.5 by rads), Ain't Like That Now (×1.25) | 39 Action Point Regen | Multiply |

What the masters hold for the helpers [observed: FalloutNV.esm]: the NPC_ `Stranger`
("Mysterious Stranger", 0005F9CE) with `MysteriousStranger44Magnum` and its own projectile,
faction and combat style; `MissFortune` (0013568A) with "Miss Fortune's Bad Luck Bringer",
whose enchantment casts `MissFortuneGunSpell` (script NVMissFortuneGunSpellScript) and the
knockdown, paralysis, blow-up and plasma spells; the music stingers
`MUSMysteriousStrangerA01`/`A02`; the camera path `MysteriousStrangerCameras` and 13
`MystStrangerCam*` shots; the GMSTs `fVATSStrangerOdds` 0.1, `fVATSFortuneOdds` 0.1,
`fVATSStrangerDistance` 164, `iVATSStrangerMaxHP` 150; the challenge "He Moves in
Mysterious Ways". NVForever already counts "Mysterious Stranger Visits" in the misc
statistics (`misc_stats.rs`) but nothing raises it.

How the original uses them [hypothesis from the names and the fandom page: "10% chance that
the Mysterious Stranger will finish off a target in V.A.T.S."; Miss Fortune "will
incapacitate a target"]: on a VATS attack, odds 0.1 (× Friendly Help's 2) that the helper
appears about 164 units from the player and kills the target (the Stranger) or knocks it
down, paralyses it or blows up its weapon (Miss Fortune); the 150 HP is presumably the
most health a target may have left for the Stranger to be sent. These need checking in the
original before building (an AI observer capture), or a decision to adapt them to VATS
mode, which is NVForever's own (vats-mode.md): VATS mode fires every mark at once, so the
roll would be one per mark as it fires.

### 3.2 Attack, reload, equip and run speed

| Entry point | Perks |
|---|---|
| 37 Reload Speed | Rapid Reload × 1.25 |
| 38 Equip Speed | Quick Draw × 1.5 |
| 43 Modify Attack Speed | Fast Shot × 1.2, Trigger Discipline × 0.8, Loose Cannon × 1.3, Slayer × 1.3, Melee Hacker × 1.05/1.1, Old Vaquero × 1.33 and Causeless Rebel × 1.3 (teammate perks), Elijah's Last Words × 1.5, Atomic! × 1.25, Ain't Like That Now × 1.2, NVDLC04RushingWaterEffectsPerk × 1.5 |
| 42 Modify Run Speed | Travel Light × 1.1 (light or no armour), Tunnel Runner × 1.25 (sneaking, light armour), Implant M-5 × 1.2 (sneaking), Atomic! × 1.25, Stealth Suit Mk II × 1.2, NVDLC03LobotimiteReduceSpeedPERK × 0.75 |

perk-entry-points.md §2 left 37/38/43 until the player body's clips can play faster; the
run speed has no such block.

### 3.3 Weight, carrying and fast travel

| Entry point | Perks |
|---|---|
| 55 Modify Light Items | Pack Rat (Set 1): items at most `fPackRatThreshold` weigh × `fPackRatModifier` [documented: GECK wiki]; neither GMST is in FalloutNV.esm [observed], the perk's text says "2 or less weigh half" |
| 73 Adjust Heavy Weapon Weight | Heavyweight × 0.5: weapons of 10 lb or more after weight mods |
| 22 Get Max Carry Weight | Hoarder + 25 (its −1 SPECIAL ability works) |
| 51 Has Fast Travel Always | Long Haul: fast travel while over-encumbered |

### 3.4 Locks, terminals, sneaking

| Entry point | Perks |
|---|---|
| 32 Ignore Broken Lock | Infiltrator: another try at a broken lock |
| 20 Ignore Locked Terminal | Computer Whiz: another try at a locked-out terminal |
| 31 Ignore Running During Detection | Silent Running: running no longer counts against sneaking (`fSneakRunningMult` is read in detection) |

### 3.5 Explosives, throwing, mines

| Entry point | Perks |
|---|---|
| 72 Adjust Explosion Radius | Splash Damage × 1.25 |
| 59 Modify Throwing Velocity | Heave, Ho! × 1.5, Loose Cannon × 0.75 (with a condition) |
| 4 Calculate Mine Explode Chance | Light Step (Set 0), In My Footsteps (Set 0, Dead Money), ED-E's Light Step (Lonesome Road, for ED-E) |

### 3.6 Melee, unarmed and knockdowns

| Entry point | Perks |
|---|---|
| 52 Knockdown Chance | Super Slam 0.15/0.30, And Stay Back 0.1, Elijah's Last Words 0.25 |
| 61, 62, 64, 65, 66 Has Unarmed … Power Attack / Counter | Legion Assault, Ranger Takedown, Scribe Counter, Khan Trick (the trainers' special moves) |
| 53 Modify Weapon Strength Req | Weapon Handling Set 2 |
| 54 Modify Aiming Move Speed | Run 'n Gun × 2 |
| 3 Calculate Weapon Attack AP Cost | Ain't Like That Now × 0.8 (attacks outside VATS cost AP in the original only through this) |

### 3.7 Kills, health, repair, the HUD

| Entry point | Perks |
|---|---|
| 46 Has Meltdown | Meltdown: foes killed by energy weapons explode |
| 47 See Enemy Health | Living Anatomy: the target's health and DT on its bar (its damage bonus works) |
| 48 Has Jury Rigging | Jury Rigging: repair with roughly similar items |
| 12 Modify Recovered Health | Better Healing × 1.2, Cardiac Arrest × 1.25: natural healing, which NVForever does not have |
| 26 Adjust Drinking Radiation | Implant Y-3 × 0.01: water sources (environment radiation is built) |

### 3.8 Companion perks

| Entry point | Perks |
|---|---|
| 69 Has Improved Detection | Enhanced Sensors (ED-E, base and Lonesome Road): compass range, cloaked targets in VATS |
| 70 Has Improved Spotting | Spotter (Boone): enemies highlighted while aiming |
| 71 Has Improved Item Detection | Search and Mark (Rex): items highlighted while aiming |

### 3.9 VATS's hit chance (built 2026-10-23)

Entry point 8 Calculate To Hit Chance (Commando, Gunslinger, Sniper, Wired Reflexes, Hobbler,
the to-hit half of Fast Shot, Trigger Discipline, Sneering Imperialist, Camarader-E,
Lonesome Road) and 33 Has Concentrated Fire change VATS's hit chance. When this audit was
written VATS mode never missed, so these perks had nothing to change. The owner chose a
hit chance (2026-10-23): VATS mode now has one, and both entry points apply to it
(vats-mode.md §17). The appendix's statuses are as audited, before that.

## 4. Proposed build order

1. **VATS helpers and AP** (§3.1): Mysterious Stranger, Miss Fortune, Friendly Help, Grim
   Reaper's Sprint, Nerves of Steel. Five player perks, one system; the helpers want an
   observer look at the original first.
2. **Locks, terminals, sneaking, weight, fast travel** (§3.3, §3.4): eight perks, each a
   small change where the system already exists.
3. **Explosives, throws, mines, run speed** (§3.5, §3.2's 42): Splash Damage, Heave Ho!,
   Light Step and the run-speed perks.
4. **Kills and HUD** (§3.7): Meltdown, Living Anatomy, Jury Rigging, Implant Y-3.
5. **Clip speeds** (§3.2's 37, 38, 43): needs the player body's playback rate.
6. **Knockdowns and the unarmed moves** (§3.6): needs melee knockdown and the special
   moves (and their VATS forms).
7. **Companion perks** (§3.8) and natural healing (Better Healing).
8. §3.9: decided and built 2026-10-23, a hit chance in VATS mode (vats-mode.md §17).
