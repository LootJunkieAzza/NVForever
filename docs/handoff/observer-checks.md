# Observer checks: gameplay guesses the original game can settle

Guesses about how the original behaves that a capture can settle without the owner.
The observer can run scripts, take screenshots, record video, and tap keys, so it can
also drive menus. Sorted by how much of the game each check moves, most first.
Taken from the old owner-review log on 2026-10-24 (full log:
`git show 85dcaace:docs/owner-review.md`); decisions that need the owner are in
[owner-review.md](../owner-review.md).

Tools: [ai-observer](../spec-notes/ai-observer.md) (campaigns, fight field set, events,
timed actions, shots), [xnvse-capture](../spec-notes/xnvse-capture.md) (jobs and short
scripts), [owner-decision-captures](../spec-notes/owner-decision-captures.md) (what
earlier rounds settled). Start from the `nvfstrip` save unless a check needs an early
game state. When a check is settled, write the answer into the linked spec, fix the
engine if needed, and delete the item here.

## What the open checks need (2026-10-31)

- **Unattended, from the saves we have** (a session can run them): 1, 2, the rest of 3,
  5 (weapon health around scripted shots), 6 (nvftest, Sunny), the rest of 8, 11 (72 h at a raised
  TimeScale), 13, 15, 20, 21, 22 (dialogue events), the rest of 33, 35, 36, 52, 53, and
  #1076 (melee reach; measured 2026-11-01, o14_reach: combat-rules §8).
- **A save from the owner** (quest or character state no save has yet):
  - Hardcore on: done (nvfHardcore).
  - Boone, Rex and ED-E hired (19, 22's complaints, 18's wheel): Boone done (nvfBoone).
  - Old World Blues just started in the Think Tank (43, 37); X-8 done, EM pulse module
    (38). Honest Hearts at Flight from Zion with Daniel (49).
  - VMS46 at Anders' thanks (39); Stone on his night route, VMS31 (50); HELIOS One before
    the west terminal (46, 25 at Intelligence 1); Oliver on House's path (48); a finished
    game at the end slides (28 and 29 answered).
- **A save made inside the capture** (allowed, probe-saves rule): 24 (save half-way along
  a patrol, reload), 41 (the emergency radio, timed).
- **Screenshots or video** (window in front, both locks): 7 (casino menus by key taps),
  12 (Ringo, Nash, Red Lucy, Doc Mitchell: nvftest/nvfdoc have them), 16, 17, 26, 27, 54.

## P1: changes many fights or the whole run

1. **Which weapon NPCs carry and draw.** Ours ranks weapons by base damage plus
   explosion damage, so about 40 NPCs now draw grenade rifles or launchers. Any AddItem
   (even caps) makes an NPC equip its best weapon and armour again. Melee Only / Ranged
   Only styles switch weapons only in combat. To check: read GetEquippedObject 5 on
   those 40 NPCs and on a sample of armed NPCs at first load, and again after AddItem
   and after a combat start. ([npc-behaviour-compare §9.1](../spec-notes/npc-behaviour-compare.md),
   [combat-ai §18](../design/combat-ai.md), [companion-wheel §4](../spec-notes/companion-wheel.md))
   Answered in part 2026-11-01 (o13_reequip, nvftest at noon, observer `weapon` field
   every 5 loops, nobody in combat or with a weapon out) [observed]. At load: Sunny a
   Varmint Rifle, Easy Pete and Settler 1 a .357 Revolver, Ringo a 9mm Pistol (Trudy
   not in the loaded area). Then, to all of them in turn:
   - `AddItem` 10 caps: nobody's weapon changed.
   - a Hunting Rifle and 20 .308: **Easy Pete and Ringo equipped it at once** (holstered,
     out of combat); Sunny kept her Varmint Rifle, Settler 1 his .357.
   - a Grenade Rifle and 10 40mm grenades: **nobody** took it.
   - a Sledgehammer: no change.
   So an AddItem can re-equip outside combat, but a Grenade Rifle did not outrank a
   Hunting Rifle, a .357 or a Varmint Rifle, as it does in ours (base plus explosion
   damage): ours' ranking is the divergence. Why Sunny and Settler 1 kept theirs (skill,
   a weapon of their own class, condition) is open. The first tries (o11_02, o11_03,
   steps jobs) failed on the plugin compiling only one full script per job
   (xnvse-capture.md §6).
   In combat (o15_round, nvfairport, 2026-11-01) [observed]: a trooper holding a 10mm
   Pistol and one holding a Hunting Rifle, each also carrying a Grenade Rifle and 20
   40mm grenades, kept their own gun drawn through 42 and 15 shots; neither drew the
   Grenade Rifle. Same divergence as above (ours would draw it).
2. **Who attacks you, and who joins a fight.** Ours:
   - 618 placed Aggressive (not Very Aggressive) animals ignore you until attacked.
   - Inside an aggro radius, an actor warns twice 5 s apart, then attacks.
   - Actors of a leveled template take the factions of our level-1 entry (192 types).
   - Sharing a faction or base NPC makes actors allies.
   - Onlookers who would be attacked by the attacker join at once.
   - Cowardly actors never help.
   - An escort fights its charge's attackers.
   - Anyone hostile to you is hostile to your teammates, and teammates ignore your hits.
   - People on Find with Allow Killing attack only actors carrying the item (creatures
     hunt anything; already captured).
   To check: run campaigns near coyotes, rats and bighorners at Goodsprings, the Primm
   ambushers, a gecko attack on a settler, an escort, and shots at Boone, with the fight
   field set and OnStartCombat events. ([factions](../spec-notes/factions.md),
   [combat-ai §10, §12, §13](../design/combat-ai.md), [followers](../design/followers.md),
   [packages §3.1](../spec-notes/packages.md))
   Tried 2026-11-01 (o16_air, nvfairport runway, mortal player healed by script, nothing
   set on the player) [observed]: two spawned CrCoyote (GetAV Aggression 1, Aggressive)
   700 units off detected the player and fought it unprovoked (one in combat at once,
   the other OnStartCombat about 1 s in; 13 bites); two more at 250 units the same (15
   bites). Two VCrTier2GeckoMed (Aggression 2) were in combat at once. Two CrDogWild
   (Aggression 1) at 250 units never detected the player (GetDetected 0) and started no
   combat in 0.2 game hours. So Aggressive coyotes do not wait to be attacked: ours'
   first rule does not hold for them (#1341). Open: why the wild dogs never detected
   the player, placed (not spawned) animals, warnings, allies, onlookers, escorts.
   (killall between sessions left the earlier spawns standing: later sessions had them
   around too.)
3. **Damage numbers.** Ours:
   - Power attacks do 3× standing and 2× moving.
   - A damage type uses its resistance in place of DR (capped at 85 %, after DT).
   - Rippers, Chainsaw and Thermic Lance ignore DT/DR.
   - `fCombatPlayerLimbDamageMult` halves damage to the player's limbs.
   - Difficulty multipliers are 2/1.5/1/0.75/0.5 dealt and the inverse taken, including
     limb, burn and poison damage and your own grenades.
   - Your own explosives hurt you.
   - A second burn or poison hit restarts the timer rather than stacking.
   - Every weapon's Crit Effect applies.
   - Fall damage is 0.0252 × (h − 600)^1.65, with no leg crippling — answered
     2026-10-31 (o6_00): the formula holds within 1 %, but each fall also hurts one leg
     (+700: 24.9 of 100, half the Health lost; +1000 and +1300: crippled). Built since
     (#1129): one random leg loses half the damage (physics.md §6.12).
   To check: OnHit events plus Health and limb values for each case.
   ([combat-rules §10](../spec-notes/combat-rules.md),
   [weapon-data-fields](../spec-notes/weapon-data-fields.md),
   [crippled-limbs](../spec-notes/crippled-limbs.md), [difficulty](../spec-notes/difficulty.md),
   [hit-effects](../spec-notes/hit-effects.md), [physics §6.12](../spec-notes/physics.md))
   Player limbs, 2026-11-01 (o17_air limbs_10mm, nvfairport, mortal player, a trooper's
   10mm Pistol, three runs to the player's death, 38 hits) [observed]: each body hit
   took 16.06 Health; the arm or leg hit lost the same 16.06 of its condition, the torso
   (EnduranceCondition) 6.69 (0.4167 of it); a head hit took 32.12 Health and 20.075
   PerceptionCondition (0.625 of the Health lost, as on one larger 76.12 head hit). So
   nothing halved arm and leg damage here; whether ours' `fCombatPlayerLimbDamageMult`
   halving is cancelled by body-part multipliers is open (#1345). The lead-pipe trooper
   never landed a blow in 0.15 h (no data).
4. **Hardcore needs and waiting.** Partly answered 2026-10-31 (o7_00, o7_05, owner save
   nvfHardcore, TimeScale 30, about 59 frames a second):
   - The needs rise at our rates [observed]: Dehydration 2 every 0.168 game hours
     (about 11.8 an hour, one point every 10 s of play), Hunger 15 and SleepDeprevation
     7 over 3.2 hours (4.7 and 2.2 an hour, whole points). The "9.6" once written here was
     stale; ours uses 10 s, 25 s and 50 s a point (needs.rs).
   - Dehydration once fell from 27 to 5 between two samples, with nothing done
     [observed, unexplained; one case].
   - `IsHardcore` read 0 in this Hardcore save, so it does not tell whether Hardcore is
     on. SetHardcore 1 on nvfairport still did nothing: the needs stayed 0 for two hours
     (o6_00-01).
   - Beer and Nuka-Cola, drunk by EquipItem, raised Dehydration by no more than the
     normal rate over 11 s (14, 14, 15 and 15, 15, 16) [observed]. The job had `tgm` on
     at the time (o7_00 steps 6 to 101; it went off before the Stimpak) [observed: the
     job file], and their Dehydration +20 / +10 holds only on `IsHardcore == 1`, the
     same condition the Hardcore Stimpak passed [observed: FalloutNV.esm CTDA]. So god
     mode most likely kept it off; ours now does the same in god mode and keeps the
     rise without it (#1167, aid-items §3). Still open: a drink in Hardcore without tgm.
   - Waits and sleeps (owner, 2026-10-31, from all needs at 0, Pip-Boy values)
     [observed]: 3 hours waited give H2O 36, FOD 12, SLP 6; 3 hours slept give H2O 36,
     FOD 12, SLP 2. So 12, 4 and 2 an hour, whole points; sleep did not bring SLP below
     2. In Hardcore, sleep heals neither Health nor crippled limbs; outside it heals
     both, in full (owner). Ours does all of this since #1177 (needs.rs).
   - Still open: Buffout.
   ([aid-items §2, §6, §11](../spec-notes/aid-items.md),
   [wait-menu](../spec-notes/wait-menu.md))
5. **Weapon wear.** Ours:
   - A melee swing wears the weapon only when it lands (once per swing).
   - A record's Damage-to-Weapon Mult replaces 0.2 rather than multiplying it, so the
     Flamer, Incinerator, chainsaw and Rippers now wear 5× faster.
   - NPC weapons wear like the player's.
   To check: weapon health before and after N swings and shots, per weapon.
   ([combat-rules §17–§18](../spec-notes/combat-rules.md))
   Answered in part 2026-11-01 (o14_reach, nvfairport, god-mode player) [observed]: NPC
   melee weapons (knife, sledgehammer, super sledge, lead pipe, bumper sword) stayed at
   GetWeaponHealthPerc 99.9 through 12-16 swings and about 13 landed blows each; ours
   would take a lead pipe to 94.8. Repeated on a mortal player (o15_round, no god mode,
   healed every 20 samples): GetEquippedCurrentHealth 5 stayed exact, lead pipe 49.95
   over 10 swings with blows landing, sledgehammer 149.85 over 12; and NPC guns did not
   wear either: a 10mm Pistol 79.92 over 42 shots, a Hunting Rifle 299.7 over 15. So
   these NPCs' weapons do not wear from their own attacks (Cook-Cook's Incinerator did,
   §17: the override weapons may differ). Open: the player's own swings and shots.
6. **Detection.** Ours:
   - Light level is ambient + sun + lamps; sunlight counts only where unshaded.
   - FOV is 95° each side, and sneak-running counts as running.
   - A lit flashlight doesn't raise your light.
   - Impacts and explosions alert at their own sound levels, and creature footsteps
     count ×2 Loud / ×0.2 Silent.
   - Lying on a bed counts as asleep.
   To check: GetDetected player while walking up to Sunny at noon and at night, with the
   flashlight on, on a porch, and with a missed shot near a sleeper.
   ([detection §8](../design/detection.md))
   Tried 2026-11-01 (o14_detect, nvfairport, a spawned NCR trooper 500/1000/2000 units
   off, player still, noon and midnight), not settled: `player.SetForceSneak 1` from the
   console left IsSneaking 0, and no trooper ever had GetDetected player 1, even at 500
   units at noon (240-280 samples each; package type 1, procedures 11/17). Next time:
   sneak with a key tap (the plugin's tap) and check IsSneaking, and use Sunny or a
   settler of the save rather than a spawned trooper, whose detection may not run while
   it is idle out of combat [hypothesis].
   Retried 2026-11-01 (o16_town, nvftest, player still, GetDetected player on every
   nearby actor every loop) [observed]:
   - `TapControl 8` toggles sneak: IsSneaking went 0 to 1 (and, in a session that began
     sneaking, 1 to 0). Sessions do not reload the save, so sneak carries over.
   - The save's own residents do detect: outdoors at noon, 400 units from Settler 1,
     three residents had GetDetected 1 at times while the player stood; at midnight five
     of eight had it 1 while standing, and after the tap to sneak four of them dropped to
     0 within 14-50 loops, two coming back to 1 for a while later.
   - Indoors at noon 600 units from Sunny's spot (cell 00106185), none of the four
     actors there detected the player standing or sneaking. Sunny's ref was not among
     them [hypothesis: she was elsewhere at noon].
   So the spawned troopers' 0 in o14_detect was the trooper, not the readout. Not yet
   enough for the light, FOV or flashlight rules: next, sneak at noon vs midnight from
   the same spot and distances, by settler, with the flashlight on.
7. **Casino payouts.**
   - Slots: ours pays back about 1.35 per chip, so max winnings come fast. Check the
     reading of "= BET × N", the cherry rule and the middle row.
   - Blackjack: the dealer doesn't peek, split aces play on, one split only, surrender
     returns half rounded up, comps come at ¼ / ½ / ¾ of max winnings.
   To check: drive many hands and spins by key taps and read caps and chips.
   ([slots](../spec-notes/slots.md), [blackjack](../spec-notes/blackjack.md))
8. **Package timing.**
   - SetPackDuration 60 switched every 10–70 game minutes in the original. What does
     the number count?
   - A schedule duration with no start hour ends only when the goal is met.
   - Sandbox sit and stand times are our own numbers.
   - An unreachable package is set aside for 1 h.
   - MP A gives up her escort half-way in the original.
   - Random NPC chats start only with you within 300 units.
   - Force greets need a clear line, but facing doesn't matter.
   - A woken sleeper talks within 8 s and stays up 30 game-seconds.
   - People during a wait walk an hour's worth each hour.
   - **A far actor heading for you, past what was captured** (Malcolm Holmes, settled
     in part 2026-10-24: hourly jumps along a route, [ai-observer §13](../spec-notes/ai-observer.md)).
     Answered 2026-10-31 (`holmes_far_long`, 14 h after the player moved): he follows
     the old route to its end (ten more hourly jumps), then heads for where the player
     is now, as ours plans again then.
   To check: observer timelines, which already record packages.
   ([actor-behaviour §3, §5.5–§5.6, §5.9](../design/actor-behaviour.md),
   [owner-decision-captures §7](../spec-notes/owner-decision-captures.md))

## P2: rules met often

9. **Aid, perks and stats.** Ours:
   - Medicine/Food potency is 1 + 2 × the user's skill / 100, and Buffout boosts food
     healing.
   - Addiction: +30 usage per use, chance (usage − 70)/100, and it never wears off.
   - The Hardcore Stimpak heals 5/s for 6 s, and a normal Stimpak heals every limb.
     In Hardcore at Medicine 15 (o7_05, 2026-10-31) [observed]: about 6 Health a second
     for about 6 s, 36 in all; a crippled leg (LeftMobilityCondition 0) stayed at 0
     (o7_00). Ours now rounds the potency-scaled 6.5 down to 6 (#1167, aid-items §4);
     a second Medicine value would tell rounding from another base.
   - A second dose doesn't re-run Start.
   - Only the highest rank of a ranked perk applies, and perks are the player's only.
   - Chemist doubles the Stealth Boy.
   - Skill books give 3 points (4 with Comprehension).
   - Worn bonuses (Vault Jumpsuit Speech +2) are not in actor values.
   - GetBaseActorValue includes ModActorValue — answered 2026-10-31: in the original it
     does not (Strength base 5, ModAV 2: GetBaseAV 5, GetAV 7), and neither does ours
     (`get_base_actor_value`, actor-values.md §1); the note here was stale.
   - Calm Heart's +50 Health goes to every teammate.
   - Four Eyes ignores "PER > 1".
   To check: read actor values in scripts around each use.
   ([aid-items](../spec-notes/aid-items.md), [levelup §9](../spec-notes/levelup.md),
   [skill-books](../spec-notes/skill-books.md))
10. **Karma, reputation and crime.** Ours:
    - Killing Very Evil gives +100, Good −100, and murdering a Neutral −25 — partly
      answered 2026-10-31 (o6_02): −500 victims gave +100 and a +900 one −100 (ours gives
      0 for −500, "Evil"); a 0 victim by KillActor 0. The 2026-10-19 convict (−500 only
      through a levelled template) gave 0, so the reward may read the base's own karma
      (crime-karma.md §4.1). Still open: a real murder of a Neutral.
    - Each owned take or lock is −5.
    - A seen theft is +2 infamy and any seen kill +30, including hostile Powder Gangers.
    - An owner who sees a theft attacks at once.
    - Trespass: two warnings 5 s apart, then attack.
    - Crime fights can't be yielded.
    - Templated NPCs take their template's karma.
    - Unclamped AddReputationExact; 15/50/100 % levels for the eight reputations not
      captured.
    To check: read GetAV Karma (already in the header) and GetReputation around each act.
    ([crime-karma](../spec-notes/crime-karma.md))
11. **Vendors and loot.** Ours:
    - Vendors sell only their flagged categories and their vendor chest, but buy
      anything.
    - Restock follows Ringo's days for everyone.
    - Death items are rolled at death; the template's list wins.
    - Spent casings are player only, doubled by Hand Loader.
    - Respawn-flagged corpses return after 72 h at full health.
    - An encounter zone's level is fixed when its cell enters the loaded area (Easy to
      Boss is 50/75/125/200 %).
    - The three placed weapons that name their ammo give it once.
    To check: barter screenshots, inventory dumps, and timelines over 72 h.
    ([vendor-services](../spec-notes/vendor-services.md),
    [death-items](../spec-notes/death-items.md), [encounter-zones](../spec-notes/encounter-zones.md),
    [dead-on-spawn §4](../spec-notes/dead-on-spawn.md))
12. **Dialogue rules.** Ours:
    - Greetings flagged Goodbye are said at you; when an actor starts the conversation
      they hold you for one line.
    - A generic Goodbye is added where the only Goodbye has an end script (100+ lists).
    - Tab leaves only where a Goodbye is offered.
    - A skipped line still runs its end script.
    - Spent Say Once questions vanish.
    - No pause is added between voiced lines (scenes run 0.3–0.4 s short per line).
    - Shared (Info Connection) lines count as the topic's own.
    - Corner and quest messages wait until the conversation ends.
    - Voices without Allow Default Dialog get no generic lines.
    To check: screenshots and video of Ringo, Nash, Red Lucy and Doc Mitchell's stage 40.
    ([dialogue-play](../design/dialogue-play.md), [dialogue](../spec-notes/dialogue.md),
    [voice](../spec-notes/voice.md))
13. **Speeds and turning.** Settled (actors §8.10): people's walk and run with their
    armour and two-handed weapons, and creatures' walks and runs (clip pace × scale ×
    Speed Mult × their skeleton's share). Still open, ours:
    - People turn ≤180°/s walking, 120°/s standing; creatures 300°/s × scale (measured
      on cazadors only); the CREA Turning Speed field is unused.
    - Speed Mult on people: one actor (Cook-Cook, 110) ran as if it were 100 (asked in
      owner-review.md).
    - People walking with a weapon drawn (77–78 seen outside combat, about 100 in
      combat) are not built.
    - Follow distances: stand within distance + 64, run beyond 512.
    - Aiming or blocking slows you to a walk.
    - Swimming starts at 115 units deep.
    - The step-up is 24 units with a 45° slope limit.
    To check: the fight field set at every loop gives positions and headings; flat open
    ground and a cleared area: the `nvfairport` save (campaign `creature_runs`).
    ([actors §8.9–§8.10](../spec-notes/actors.md), [physics §6.4.2](../spec-notes/physics.md))
14. **Script rules that differ from the wiki.**
    - A call on an empty ref is skipped — partly answered 2026-10-31 (o5_00): in a
      function script run through xNVSE's CallFunction, `rE.GetDisabled` on an unset
      `ref`, alone or as an `if` condition, let the script go on (the next line ran). Ours
      stops the script (game.rs `stop_run`, scripts.md §4.2). Still open: the same in a
      quest or object script run by the game itself, before ours changes.
    - Return ends one block only.
    - Scripted items in other inventories don't run.
    - Message boxes don't freeze the player, and MenuMode 1002 is our guess.
    - The GetWeaponAnimType table (Sunny's tutorial depends on it).
    - tgm lifts carry weight and keeps magazines full.
    - Scripted UseWeapon runs before the combat AI; melee UseWeapon walks up to the
      target.
    - Quest items can be stored in containers.
    To check: short-script jobs for each.
    ([script-language](../spec-notes/script-language.md), [scripts §10](../spec-notes/scripts.md),
    [use-weapon](../design/use-weapon.md))
15. **Survival hazards.**
    - Environment radiation: strongest marker wins, and water gives 1 rad/s (2 if
      radioactive).
    - The Fat Man zone fades from 10 to 0 rads/s over 12 s within 616 units.
    - Turbo slows the world to 0.5.
    - A crippled head means a 40 s concussion.
    - A crippled arm makes an NPC drop its weapon.
    - Knockdowns last 3 s.
    - Only BMDT Power Armor needs training.
    - Traps give 2 XP (your note said 5).
    To check: actor values and events.
    ([radiation](../spec-notes/radiation.md), [magic-archetypes](../spec-notes/magic-archetypes.md),
    [unconscious §5.4](../spec-notes/unconscious.md), [traps](../spec-notes/traps.md))
    Tried 2026-11-01 (o14_hazards, nvfairport, god-mode player) [observed]:
    - Crippled arm: a trooper firing a 10mm Pistol kept it drawn and fired on for 40 s
      after `DamageAV RightAttackCondition 200`; both arms at 0 the same. So a scripted
      crippling does not disarm (crippled-limbs §3); a crippling **shot** is still to try.
    - Knockdown length: not captured. `player.PushActorAway <spawned> 60` knocked
      neither a free-standing trooper nor a gecko (GetKnockedState stayed 0); next time
      use a placed explosion on a free-standing spawned actor (blast_knockdown's setup).
      Tried that too (o15_round): `rA.PlaceAtMe GrenadeFragExplosion 1` and
      `WeaponKnockdownExplosion` from a timed script on a free-standing spawned trooper
      gave no OnHit and no GetKnockedState change. Placed by the spawned actor's own
      PlaceAtMe in a timed script, the explosion seems not to go off [hypothesis]; next
      time place it on a save's own actor as blast_knockdown did on Ringo.
      Retried 2026-11-01 (o16_town, nvftest): `RingoRef.PlaceAtMe GrenadeFragExplosion 1`
      (in GSGasStation) and the same on Settler 1 outdoors: no OnHit, no Health change, no
      GetKnockedState 2, so the placed explosion did not go off on the save's own actors
      either. The 2026-10 knockdown_look timeline (PushActorAway 10/40/120 on Ringo) also
      has GetKnockedState 0 throughout. Script-placed explosions and PushActorAway knock
      nobody down in these captures; next: a grenade thrown by an NPC (o12's dynamite
      ganger) at a spawned actor, or the player firing a grenade rifle by TapControl 4
      (the tap fires: see 53).

## P3: smaller or rarer

16. **HUD and menus.**
    - The enemy health bar and red crosshair show only for hostiles, or for anyone hit in
      the last 5 s.
    - Sneak-indicator states. Does a following companion (or an actor on a Follow
      package on the player) seeing the player leave the word at [HIDDEN]? Does a
      neutral (non-hostile) NPC seeing the player give [DETECTED]? (#1159)
    - Compass ticks within PER × 300; markers within PER × 2048.
    - "How many?" asks only above 5 (barter) or above 1 (crafting).
    - The crafting filter arrows.
    - Wait pace: 1 hour per 0.5 s, and it can be cancelled.
    - Wait refusals: within 2,048 units outdoors, 1,024 indoors.
    - Hacking word lengths by difficulty; a bracket resets attempts 1 in 5.
    - Holotapes keep playing with the Pip-Boy closed.
    - A second ShowTutorialMenu adds a page.
    - Aid effects are shown as totals.
    - The order of misc stats after #16, and what Barter Amount Traded counts.
    - Caravan currencies: caps first, then the least valued notes.
    - Cannibal and Sandman show a choice box.
    Screenshots. ([hud §8–§10](../spec-notes/hud.md), [wait-menu §9](../spec-notes/wait-menu.md),
    [hacking](../spec-notes/hacking.md), [misc-stats](../spec-notes/misc-stats.md))
17. **Weapons and bodies, by video.**
    - Minigun spin-up on every press and after a reload.
    - The Grenade Launcher reloads round by round.
    - Bodies go limp at once, with no death clip.
    - Shove speeds: shots 140, blows 220, bottles about 3 m/s.
    - Corpses: the player walks through them.
    - Small creatures block the player.
    - Bodies over 250 mass can't be pushed.
    - Loose items rest until touched.
    - Pushed NPCs move at half speed and return after 2 s (the `pc_actor_push` capture is
      ready).
    ([animation §9.8](../spec-notes/animation.md), [ragdoll §4](../spec-notes/ragdoll.md),
    [physics §4.3.1, §6.8, §6.10–§6.11](../spec-notes/physics.md))
18. **NPC odds and ends.**
    - Doors stay open behind NPCs.
    - No ledge links.
    - Locked doors are closed to NPCs unless they carry the key.
    - Idle conditions ignored for PlayIdle.
    - Sitting is instant for the player and holsters the weapon.
    - Followers arrive 160 units to your left (captured) and every teammate follows
      through doors.
    - Package-less actors walk home after a fight.
    - Creatures with Can't Open Doors never use load doors (the Searchlight ghouls
      following Edwards).
    - The companion-wheel details.
    - Challenges count every kill.
    - Quest targets indoors are marked at one door.
    ([navmesh §7](../design/navmesh.md), [idles](../spec-notes/idles.md),
    [furniture §5, §7](../spec-notes/furniture.md), [packages §7](../spec-notes/packages.md),
    [challenges](../spec-notes/challenges.md))

19. **The companion perks' highlights.** Ours: Spotter (Boone) and Search and Mark
    (Rex) glow only while the player aims with a weapon out; Spotter marks the actors
    the compass shows red within its range; Search and Mark marks chems, Stimpaks, guns,
    energy weapons and ammunition within 1,500 units; Enhanced Sensors (ED-E) sets the
    compass's actor range to Perception 10's. To check: with each companion hired, a
    frame before and while aiming near hostiles and near dropped items (a Stimpak, a
    pistol, a melee weapon, food) at a few distances; the compass with ED-E at low
    Perception. ([perk-entry-points §13](../spec-notes/perk-entry-points.md))
    Spotter answered 2026-10-31 by the owner (save nvfBoone) [observed]: the red outline
    shows only while aiming (none with the weapon drawn and not aiming) and goes when
    aiming stops; it marks every hostile actor or creature, whether or not it is in
    combat with the player; and it seems to reach every enemy in render distance. Ours
    matches the first two; its reach was the detection reach (5,000 units outdoors),
    shorter than the loaded area, and is now as far as actors are drawn (#1171). The owner's screenshot: distant
    enemies at night look tinted red all over; Boone is not marked. Two more shots show
    the red pulsing (faint, then strong) [observed], as the record says: edge pulse
    amplitude 0.5 at 1 a second, edge fall-off 0.5 (EFSH 0x0015FF60), which ours plays
    through effect-shaders.md's pulse rule. Search and Mark (Rex) and
    Enhanced Sensors (ED-E) are still open.

## Added 2026-10-25 (from the ESM-gap work)

The numbers above stay put so links to them hold; each item here gives its own priority.

20. **NPC grenades** (P1). Ours: the first throw comes 4–10 s after the NPC sees its
    target, then one every 12–25 s, only between 1.5× the blast radius and the throw's
    reach (at most 1,500 units), and each throw takes one from the inventory.
    To check:
    - When do NPCs throw grenades or dynamite: the distance to the target, how often,
      and how soon into the fight?
    - Do they visibly switch to the grenade and back?
    - Does their count drop?
    Setup: Powder Gangers with dynamite at NCRCF, or a Legion squad.
    ([combat-ai §20](../design/combat-ai.md))
    Answered in part 2026-11-01 (o12_grenades, o13_airport gangers_far, nvfairport
    runway, god-mode player) [observed]:
    - Over 90 s at 426-1,595 units, two LvlPowderGangerGunVar carrying 4 and 5 dynamite
      **never threw** and never drew it; neither did three at 76-667 units over 24 s.
    - The third of the far run spawned with dynamite as its drawn weapon: it threw one at
      about 1,225 units within the first second (count 5 to 4), drew a gun at 4 s and
      never threw again.
    So the original does not throw carried grenades on a timer: they are thrown when
    they are the drawn weapon. Ours throws a carried grenade 4-10 s into the fight and
    every 12-25 s after (combat-ai §20): a divergence, not yet changed.
21. **Packages that send NPCs through player-only load doors** (P2). Some door
    scripts' OnActivate blocks call Activate for the player only. `fnvtool ai reach`
    (routes_through_door) still finds FalloutNV.esm packages routed through them:
    - the Strip gates (VStripGate, refs 0016A14D–0016A150), about 420 actor/package
      pairs, among them the securitrons' VStripSecuritronGuardGate*/Patrol*, the NCR
      MPs' VStripMPBPatrolEmb and the Omerta thugs' VMS33ThugLeavePackage;
    - Gomorrah's elevator doors (0010DA76, 0010D6AC, 0010D6AE, 0010DDB4), 15 pairs, e.g.
      VMS21NeroCasinoTravel and VMS21BigSalHomeTravel.

    Ours lets an NPC through a load door whatever the block did (the block still runs)
    and refuses only at doors that open in place.
    To check: does the original move these NPCs through those doors? Does a Strip
    securitron's gate patrol cross the gate? Do Nero and Big Sal go between their rooms
    and the casino floor through the elevator, or never get there?
    ([doors §5.2](../spec-notes/doors.md))
    Not settled by the `strip` timeline of 2026-10-19 (6 evening hours): no tracked actor
    left the Strip, but none was on a gate-crossing package (the MP B patrolled the
    Lucky 38, VStripMPABPatrol38, not VStripMPBPatrolEmb; the gate securitrons there are
    the Lucky 38's). Needs a campaign tracking the Strip-gate securitrons themselves.
22. **Combat answer lines and companion complaints** (P2). To check:
    - When a group-mate says NormalToAlert or NormalToCombat, does a nearby mate answer
      with NormalToAlertResponse or StartCombatResponse?
    - Are AttackResponse (BoS: "On it!") and FleeResponse (super mutants: "Coward!")
      said after Attack and Flee lines?
    - Does DeathResponse play without JIP? The wiki says it doesn't.
    - When does a companion say WeaponIneffective or ArmorIneffective? Ours says:
      - WeaponIneffective when DT cut the hit to its floor;
      - ArmorIneffective when one hit took 25 % of health with DT stopping 10 % or less;
      - each at most once a minute.

      Test: Boone with a 9mm against a high-DT target, and Boone in light armour taking
      a heavy hit.
    Read dialogue events in the observer timeline, with audio or subtitles.
    ([combat-dialogue §5](../spec-notes/combat-dialogue.md))
23. **Actor Effect spells in NPC and creature spell lists** — answered 2026-10-30 (issue
    #916): the original does not apply the type-0 entries (Tunnelers' DT, Ruthless,
    SporeCarrierRegen read IsSpellTarget 0 and base values; the Ability beside them 1), as
    ours. ([area-effects §3](../spec-notes/area-effects.md))
24. **A patrol after a load** (P3). Ours: an NPC on a non-repeating Patrol package
    goes on to its next point after a reload.
    To check: save while it is half-way along its route, reload, and see whether it
    goes on or starts again from the first point.
    ([save-load §5 item 4](../design/save-load.md))
25. **Dialogue at low Intelligence** (P3; few players run Intelligence 3 or below).
    Ours (PR #743), with the player's Intelligence at or below
    iDialogueDummySpeakThisIntOrBelow (3 in FalloutNV.esm):
    - a topic's Dumb Response (DIAL TDUM) replaces the player's line, e.g. "Pizza." for
      "Peace." in Helios One's ARCHIMEDES conversation;
    - INFO lines flagged Low Intelligence (acting note "{Dummy}") replace their High
      Intelligence twins ("{Non-Dummy}").

    To check: `player.setav intelligence 1`, then screenshots of those conversations.
    Check Intelligence 4 too: is the player dim there?
    ([dialogue §2](../spec-notes/dialogue.md))

## Added 2026-10-26 (UI tile tree)

26. **How the original's menu engine reads its files** (P2: every UI mod and MCM).
    Ours (fnv-ui):
    - `&true;` is 1 and `&false;` 0;
    - other constants are kept by name;
    - an end tag closes the innermost element of its name, else the innermost element;
    - a value a script set holds until what its expression reads changes;
    - SetUIFloat makes no trait that is not there;
    - `name:N` counts from 0 among the children of that name.

    To check: GetUIFloat on traits the files set to constants (`HUDMainMenu/locus`,
    `_CrosshairVisible`, a `justify`), DumpTileInfo on QuestAddedMenu and on MCM's
    StartMenu tree, SetUIFloat on a trait with an expression and on a missing one, and
    SetUIFloat against SetUIFloatAlt on a templated list row (the "children tiles" bug
    MCM depends on). ([menu-xml §8](../spec-notes/menu-xml.md))

    Partly answered 2026-11-01 (o11_00, nvftest, HUD in game mode) [observed]:
    - SetUIFloat makes no trait that is not there: `HUDMainMenu/_NvfNewTrait` read
      -999 (GetUIFloat's "not found") before and after `SetUIFloat … 5`, by GetUIFloat
      and by GetUIFloatAlt. As ours.
    - Constants other than `&true;`/`&false;` read as numbers: `&center;` 2
      (`HUDMainMenu/SneakMeter/sneak_nif/justify`) and `&right;` 4
      (`HUDMainMenu/XPMeter/XPAmount/justify`). Ours keeps them by name: check what our
      GetUIFloat gives on a `justify`.
    - The deprecated GetUIFloat and GetUIFloatAlt read the same on eight HUD paths,
      `*:N` paths included (`HitPoints/*:2/brightness` 175, `ActionPoints/*:5/brightness`
      255, `HitPoints/*:0/width` 345, `ActionPoints/*:0/width` 60), so `*:N` counts the
      same way for both (last matching child first, menu-xml §8 item 6).
    Still open: DumpTileInfo, a set trait with an expression, SetUIFloat against
    SetUIFloatAlt on a templated row.

## Added 2026-10-27 (first-person depth)

27. **Does the original's first-person weapon go into walls?** (P3: one look in every
    close fight indoors.) Ours draws the arms and weapon in front of the world whatever
    is nearer (first-person-depth.md §1, [hypothesis] that the original does the same).
    To check: in the Prospector Saloon, a varmint rifle drawn nose to the east wall
    (the `first-person-depth` smoke spot, feet at 469, 244, 3457 facing 80°), a screenshot
    hip-fired and one at the sights; then the same against a standing NPC. If the barrel
    is cut by the wall there, the original draws it with the world.
    ([first-person-depth](../design/first-person-depth.md))

## Added 2026-10-27 (main-quest walkthroughs)

28. **Does a SayTo that finds no line still end with SayToDone?** — answered 2026-10-31
    (o10_00, o10_01, a third party's 100% save nvfSlides at the end slides, VStoryState
    65): **yes**. The narrator's chain (SCPT 0x00161EB4) ends with VEndingConclusion's
    SayToDone starting FadeToCreditsTimer (0x0017A17C). As loaded, it started about 6.7
    minutes in. With VStoryEventKhans set to 9, which none of VEndingGreatKhans' seven
    lines accepts (they need 0 to 4), the chain still reached FadeToCreditsTimer
    [observed]. Every path of the chain passes through the Khans topic, so its SayTo found
    no line and its SayToDone still ran. Ours runs the SayToDone blocks the next frame, which
    matches. ([mq-walkthrough](mq-walkthrough-2026-10-27.md) §2)
29. **Does a line's fixed speaker (INFO ANAM) gate who says it?** — answered for the
    non-ending case 2026-10-31 (owner, from nvf38door): **no, the GetIsID condition
    decides**. After the first meeting with House, the elevator Victor in the penthouse
    (Lucky38VictorElevator, the line's GetIsID) greeted with 0x00165102, "comp you to the
    High-Roller Suite", whose fixed speaker is the entrance Victor (Lucky38VictorEntrance)
    [observed]; later talks to him open with his usual elevator greeting, as a Say
    Once line should. Ours does the same (dialogue.rs `can_say_as`). Still open: lines with a
    fixed speaker and no GetIsID condition (the Dead Money end slides, #965). The
    Boomers' end slide (VEndingBoomers, ANAM NellisPete, GetIsID Narrator) plays in the
    child Pete's voice, not the narrator's (owner, nvfSlides) [observed]; ours says it
    as the narrator with the fixed speaker's file (voice.rs), which matches. Also: the penthouse elevator can only be
    taken through this Victor's dialogue until House is dead (owner).
    ([mq-walkthrough](mq-walkthrough-2026-10-27.md) §2)
30. **Reputation axes outside 0-2** — answered 2026-10-31 (o5_00-02, RepNVNCR, scale 80):
    GetReputation axes 2 and 3 read 0; GetReputationThreshold axis 3 read 0 at every value
    tried (so Benny's "axis 3 >= 3" greeting is never chosen in the original either), and
    axes 0-2 matched ours (`reputation::tiers`) at all ten infamy/fame pairs. SetReputation
    with axis 2 or 3 is a failed call that **stops the script** (the line after it did not
    run); ours does the same since #1127 (reputation.rs `write_axis`). (scripts.md §7.6)
31. **Say Once on a line two actors share** — answered 2026-10-31 (owner, save
    nvf31mainframe, issue #1113): **no repeat**. After the upload and the Mark II upgrade
    the Yes Man mainframe greeted with 0x001164F2 (GREETING position 2424, conditions
    GetIsID YesManMainframe OR VMQTopsYesMan, VMQTops variable 32 < 1), not the Tops
    first-meeting greeting 0x001164F1 (position 2398, Say Once, only the same GetIsID OR)
    that the Tops Yes Man had said [observed]. So Say Once holds per line across speakers
    in the original [hypothesis: one case; the mainframe and the Tops Yes Man may also
    count as one speaker]. Built (#1113): ours holds a Say Once line back from every
    actor once any has said it (dialogue.rs `can_say_as`). (dialogue.md question 13)
32. **An expression that leaves extra values** — answered 2026-10-30 (issue #908): the
    original stops the script at `if GetStage Q N == 1` and runs neither arm, as ours.
    ([scripts §4.2](../spec-notes/scripts.md))

## Added 2026-10-29 (radiation falloff, issue #894; HUD states capture)

33. **Radiation falloff and Rad Resistance** — answered 2026-10-31 (o6_00): linear in
    the 3-D distance (346 units 11.412178, 602 units 9.647502, as ours to 1e-5) and
    GetRadiationLevel × (1 − Rad Resistance ÷ 100) (Rad-X: 6.291849, as ours).
    (radiation.md §2, §4) Still open (P3): overlapping markers (the Camp Searchlight
    crater's three, 1000 units from their point: ours 8.28, summed 20.09) and a Fat Man's
    zone at its centre and 300 units out. MoveTo a marker with offsets moves the player
    where SetPos did not; at two of the four points it left the player in place
    [hypothesis: points it cannot stand the player on].
34. **The corner bars' ticks' brightness** — answered 2026-10-31 (o5_00-01): the full-row
    meters read `brightness` 175 in both bars (`HUDMainMenu/HitPoints/*:2` and
    `ActionPoints/*:2`, each 296 wide and visible; the bars' other visible children 255),
    as the tile HUD writes. Read with a dialogue open over the HUD (the nvfstrip save loads
    into one). (hud.md §14.9)

## Added 2026-10-30 (issues #907, #915)

35. **A condition with a null form parameter** (GetQuestVariable on INFO 0x0014B595-7,
    GetIsID on 0x000FF5BA) — answered 2026-10-30 (issue #907): the original reads 0 for
    both; ours now does without a failed call. Open: other functions given a null form
    in a condition (ours: a failed call, also 0). ([dialogue §4](../spec-notes/dialogue.md))
36. **Which of a creature's turn rates applies when** (P3; issue #915). Steady turns are
    TNAM × 1.25, × 3 or × 0.075 °/s on every skeleton tried, whatever the base scale
    (actors.md §8.10 "TNAM"); × 0.075 is aim tracking within about 6°, but × 1.25 and × 3
    both came on big turns towards a target. To check: GetAnimAction, the movement
    speed, IsInCombat and the combat target's distance against the rate, with more turns
    per creature (e.g. a mongrel set on the player again and again from behind), and
    whether a standing turn without combat (a Travel package to a marker behind it)
    takes × 1.25 or × 3. ([actors §8.10](../spec-notes/actors.md))
    Tried 2026-11-01 (o17_air, nvfairport runway, one creature spawned 400 units behind a
    still god-mode player, heading every loop) [observed]:
    - CrCoyote: in combat at once, it turned about 125° onto the player at a steady
      187-189°/s (standing or creeping, GetAnimAction -1, 115 units off), stopping
      exactly on the bearing. Then, attacking (GetAnimAction 2) and moving 85-270 u/s,
      its heading tracked the bearing at 41-42°/s one way and 85-99°/s the other.
    - VCrTier2GeckoMed: in combat at once, it turned at a steady 599-603°/s for about
      0.15 s (the long way round, away from the bearing), then the rate fell smoothly
      from about 560 to 85°/s over the next 0.25 s while it moved off at 50-250 u/s.
    The coyote's and gecko's TNAM were not read here, so the ×1.25 / ×3 question is not
    settled; next: read their TNAM (fnvtool), set the ratio, and add a non-combat turn.

## Added 2026-10-30 (add-on walkthroughs, issue #918)

37. **Is a line that another line names as its follow-up (TCFU) said when its topic is
    chosen?** (P2: Old World Blues' Sink.) Six topics of the ten masters store a
    follow-up line first and another line after it, e.g. the Think Tank's "Topic001"
    (`NVDLC03DialogueKleinNVDLC03DoctorOLVLTopic001`): 0x01013555 (the five-line
    technologies chain that Topic000's line 0x0101432E leads into) and 0x01013559
    ("FINE. SO... YES."), whose choice Topic002 is the only way to the Sink's chip.
    Ours now passes over follow-up lines of a topic the player chooses while another line
    of it can be said (greetings and SayTo not: [dialogue §3.4](../spec-notes/dialogue.md))
    [hypothesis]. To check: in the first
    Think Tank talk, after agreeing to help, pick the technologies question and see which
    line answers, and whether "a place to stay" is offered next. The others: Doc
    Mitchell's VCG01DocMitchellTopic076 (never chosen), Mr. House's MrHouseTopic154,
    VMS46 Diane's VRRCDianeTopic003, the Think Tank's OLVLTopic006 (Dala's 0x01011333 now
    leads into Klein's 0x01011335) and Dr. O's OLVLTopic036.

38. **Does a block whose parameter is a form list run for any member?** (P3: Old World
    Blues' force fields.) `Begin OnHitWith NVDLC03SonicWeaponList` (SCPT 0x01016AB4,
    0x01016953, 0x0101571D) names a FLST of the five Sonic Emitters; ours runs the block
    when the hitting weapon is in the list (game.rs `block_accepts`) [hypothesis, fit to
    the data]. To check: with the EM pulse module downloaded (X-8), shoot a Big MT force
    field with the Sonic Emitter: Sonic Emitter Upgrade completes and the field drops.

39. **Can a Goodbye line's end script start a new conversation?** (P2: 8 end scripts, 4
    of them of Goodbye lines, e.g. Anders' thanks in VMS46, INFO 0x00142A9C.) Ours now
    holds the StartConversation and starts it once the line has closed the conversation
    [design, issue #1107]. In the original, after the line, does the new speaker
    force-greet? (mq-walkthrough §9 stall 1.)
40. **Does re-displaying a completed objective un-complete it?** — answered 2026-10-31
    (o5_00, issue #1108): no. VMS19 65 and VFSAtomicPimp 34: displayed, completed, then
    SetObjectiveDisplayed 1 again: still completed. Only showing a **hidden** objective
    clears the flag (displayed 0, then 1: not completed), which is what the VMS16 capture
    of layer5-captures.md §5.2 saw. Ours clears it on every display, so G.I. Blues can
    stall. (scripts.md §5)
41. **Does ResetQuest keep a SetQuestDelay?** — answered 2026-10-31 (o41 on nvftest, issue
    #1109): yes. VMQ03aTimer at SetQuestDelay 2, ResetQuest, StartQuest: its timer still
    dropped every 2.0 s (DATA delay 0.5 s). ResetQuest also zeroed the variables and
    stopped the running quest (GetQuestRunning 0). (layer5-captures.md §5.7)
42. **Does a stage result script's reference-less RemoveSpell act on the player?** —
    answered 2026-10-31 (o5_03 on nvfairport, issue #1110): yes. Addicted to Jet (10 doses;
    IsSpellTarget WithdrawalJet 1 over a game hour), `SetStage VDoctors 20` made it 0 within
    10 frames. The doctors' cure works in the original; ours too since #1110.
    (script-language.md §1.2) Traps for the next capture: the first addiction opens a
    message box (menu 1001) and the nvfstrip save loads into a dialogue (menu 1009); both
    pause the game, and effects do not change while it is paused.
43. **Does a newly started quest's script run before its first delay?** (P2.) Old World
    Blues: wake in the Think Tank and talk to Dr. Klein at once. Do the Big Empty's random
    encounters (NVDLC03Enc 10) start? (§10 stall 2.)
44. **What does `RemoveItem <item> 0` do?** — answered 2026-10-31 (o5_00, issue #1113):
    nothing, and the script goes on (12 Stimpaks and 21 caps stayed; the next line ran).
    Built (#1113): ours returns without removing anything (functions/items.rs
    `remove_item`).
45. **Does a second Nelson explorer stop the player right after the first?** (P3; §10
    stall 4.)
46. **Does the HELIOS One west-terminal password go to the player from Fantastic's line?**
    (P3; §10 stall 5.)
47. **Does a talking activator's scripted `Activate player` start its conversation?** —
    answered 2026-10-31 (o9_02, owner save nvfTopsAmbush: Benny's own invitation taken,
    VMQTops 20, BennyAmbush 2, BennyGoToPresidential 0): **yes**. The trigger's script
    (SCPT 0x0006919D) sets bElevatorDisabled and a 15 s timer on entry; once it runs out
    and the player is within 250 units of the intercom (0x00129556), it calls
    `SetTalkingActivatorActor Benny` and `<intercom>.Activate player`. With the player
    walked through the trigger and then standing 144 units from the intercom, the
    dialogue menu (1009) opened by itself about 14 s after the trigger (GameHour 4.80 to
    4.91 at TimeScale 30) [observed]. Ours opens nothing (#1111). An earlier try with a
    Speech-persuaded Benny (nvf47suite) had no intercom at all: Benny waits in the suite
    for the player instead (owner). (§11 stall 1.)
48. **Can Oliver be talked into retreating on House's path?** (P3.) After "You will because
    the alternative is worse", which reply does he give (Topic065 has two lines with the same
    conditions, 0x00159932 and 0x001596BD)? (§11 stall 2.)
49. **Does attacking Daniel during Flight from Zion start Chaos in Zion at once?** (P3; a hit
    starts no AI combat headless.) Also: attacked at the Northern Passage, does Jed go down
    unconscious, and does Happy Trails fail? (§11 stall 3.)
50. **Does walking behind Stone on his night route set VMS31 60 as soon as he is in view?**
    (P3; no line of sight headless.) (§11 stall 3.)
51. **Does the script language short-circuit `&&`?** — answered 2026-10-31 (o5_01, issue
    #1112): no. `if 0 && player.ModAV Variable09 10`, `if 1 || …`, `if 0 == 1 && … == 0`,
    `if 0 && 1 && …` and four more forms all ran the ModAV (+10 each time). EDEScript's
    empty-reference call each frame is the original's too; check 14 asks whether it stops
    the script there. (script-language.md §4)

## Added 2026-10-30 (the enemy bar's show rule, issue #935)

52. **How long a neutral's enemy bar lingers, and what ends it** (P3: every hurt actor
    looked at.) The hurt settler's bar was still up 16-18 s after the player turned away
    in hud_enemy5 a1-a3a, where the watch ended; a restrained hostile gecko's went after
    about 5.5 s (b2). Ours lingers 5.5 s for every actor (`hud_target::LINGER_SECONDS`):
    a known divergence for a neutral. To check: hurt a neutral settler by script (DamageAV
    Health), turn the player onto him from 350 units (not the activation target, no
    prompt), then 180 degrees away, and read `EnemyHealth`'s three children every 50 ms
    for 40-60 s with no MoveTo; then the same on a hurt restrained gecko, and on each
    after showing the bar 1 s against 10 s before the turn (hostility or the time shown
    are the candidates). ([hud §8](../spec-notes/hud.md))
    Answered in part 2026-11-01 (o12_enemybar s2, o13_town bar_end; nvftest, settler 1
    hurt by DamageAV 20, 300-350 units, no prompt) [observed]: once the bar was up (all
    three children visible) it **stayed up to the end of each session: 46 s, then 176 s
    after the player turned 180 degrees away**, while the settler walked about out of
    sight, and in the second run for 87 s after he was healed to full (RestoreAV, Health
    45 of 45). So for a hurt neutral it does not time out, and full Health does not end it
    either; the likeliest end is another actor taking the bar (not captured). Ours drops it
    after 5.5 s (`hud_target::LINGER_SECONDS`); left as is (owner, 2026-11-01). The bar
    took 10-15 s of facing to appear in both runs (the aim's pitch, most likely).
53. **Does the player's own hit show the enemy bar, and for how long?** (P2: every fight
    the player starts.) No capture had the weapon out (IsWeaponOut read 0 after the
    script's Ready taps), so no shot hit. Ours keeps its earlier guess: 5 s after the
    player hits an actor it has the bar, aimed at or not and prompt or not, while it is
    hurt (`hud_target::HIT_SECONDS`) [hypothesis]. To check: with a weapon drawn (EquipItem
    and a Ready tap confirmed by IsWeaponOut 1), shoot a neutral settler once from 350
    units with the crosshair on him, turn away at once, and read the three children every
    50 ms for 20 s; then the same with the crosshair off him at the moment of the hit (a
    shot from a script, or a grenade), and at 120 units where he is the activation target.
    ([hud §8](../spec-notes/hud.md))
    Tried 2026-11-01 (o16_town hit53_settler, nvftest, god mode) [observed]: the weapon
    can be drawn by script: `player.EquipItem Weap10mmPistol 0 1` then `TapControl 7`
    gave IsWeaponOut 1 within 17 loops; `TapControl 4` then fired one shot. But the
    shot, after a scripted SetAngle Z toward Settler 1 (GetHeadingAngle) and X 0, hit
    another actor (OnHit target 0017B64E, not in the nearby scan), not him: no settler's
    Health changed. `EnemyHealth`'s own `visible` went from 8 to 1 at the shot and its
    three children stayed 0, so no bar showed. Not settled; next: aim by GetHeadingAngle
    with pitch from the height difference (SetAngle X), the settler alone, and confirm
    the hit by his Health before reading the bar.

## Added 2026-10-30 (UI tile tree T8: the pointer and keys)

54. **The pointer on menu tiles** (P2: every menu drawn from its file, MCM's page, 16
    plugins of the modlist scan). Ours (fnv-ui `input`):
    - where two targets overlap, the highest summed `depth` takes the pointer (a tie to
      the one drawn later), and a menu opened later is over an earlier one;
    - `clicked` is 1 for the frame of the press, then 0 (the tutorial), not a count (the
      Clicked page);
    - `mouseover` is written on the tile taking the event only, not on the tiles above;
    - GetActiveUIComponentName/FullName/ID with no menu open give "", "" and -1.

    To check: GetActiveUIComponentName over an overlap of two tiles injected with
    InjectUIComponent at different depths; two injected tiles, one copying `clicked` and
    one adding it to itself, clicked twice with GetUIFloat after each click; GetUIFloat on
    a text_box button's hotrect, text and parent `mouseover` with the cursor on the text;
    the three functions in game mode and over a target without an `<id>`.
    ([menu-xml §3.2, §8 items 7-10](../spec-notes/menu-xml.md))

    Partly answered 2026-11-01 (o11_00, nvftest): in game mode with no menu open,
    GetActiveUIComponentName and GetActiveUIComponentFullName gave "" and
    GetActiveUIComponentID -1 [observed], as ours. The rest (overlap, `clicked`,
    `mouseover`, a target without an `<id>`) is still open.

## Added 2026-10-31 (the Pip-Boy Glove and outfit gloves, issue #1067)

55. **Which left hand the player shows in an outfit with gloves** (P3: the player's own
    hand in every outfit with glove addons). NVForever lets the Pip-Boy Glove give way to
    an outfit's glove addon (leather, metal, raider, ranger armour, power armour) and a
    vault suit's bare-hand addon give way to the Pip-Boy Glove. To check: the player in
    Leather Armor and in T-45d Power Armor, first and third person: is the left hand the
    outfit's glove or the Pip-Boy Glove's hand? ([actors §2.3](../spec-notes/actors.md))

## Added 2026-10-31 (radio loudness, issue #1077)

56. **Pip-Boy radio music against the DJ** (owner: the music was too quiet). Ours
    (`engine/nvf-play/src/radio.rs` `SONG_GAIN`): a song a station's line plays is at full
    level, its SOUN static attenuation left out. Most radio songs' records take 12.33 dB
    off, four take none, and all the song files are about equally loud (−30 to −34 dB
    mean), so applying it would make those four 12 dB louder than the rest [hypothesis].
    The files themselves still sit about 13 dB under the voice files (RMS as played 0.019
    against 0.080).

    To check: on Radio New Vegas, record the original's output across a song by Mr. New
    Vegas's line and across MUS_StreetsOfNewReno (0 dB) and MUS_Big_Iron (12.33 dB), at
    100% master and Radio volume; compare the songs' loudness with each other and with
    the DJ line.
    ([audio.md](../spec-notes/audio.md); radio.md)

## Added 2026-10-31 (idles that hold their actor in place, issue #1072)

57. **Whether an idle with leg tracks holds its actor in place** (P2: every scripted
    idle on a patrol or walk). NVForever holds an NPC still while an idle asked for by a
    script, a package or a dialogue line shows whose leg tracks outrank the walk clip's
    (not Upper Body), and breaks out of it (fading it out) as soon as its AI has
    somewhere to go (owner 2026-10-31). To check: Nipton, Oliver Swanick (vNiptonSurvivorREF 0x001349B6)
    on his celebrate patrol: at each marker his patrol idle time is 1 s and the marker's
    script plays `LooseCheeringBothArmsUp` (4.7 s, 1-2 passes). Sample his position
    every game loop from the marker: does he stand until the cheer ends, walk off after
    1 s with the cheer cut short, or slide with it playing? And `IsIdlePlaying` at the
    moment he sets off. ([idles §15](../spec-notes/idles.md))

## Added 2026-10-31 (coyotes' warning and charge, issue #1073)

58. **What a warning coyote plays, and how it bites on the run** (P3: every coyote and
    dog fight). NVForever plays the dog folder's `h2hequip.kf` then holds `h2haim.kf`
    while a coyote warns the player, puts it away when it attacks, and shows a blow
    begun on the run on the head and neck only, over the run. To check: VERGSCoyote6REF
    (0x00157B38) at its warning spot, the player 600-700 units off: `GetAnimAction` and
    `IsWeaponOut` sampled every game loop through its two warnings and the charge; does
    it stand with its head down (a frame), and do its legs keep running through a blow
    begun on the run or does it stop to bite? ([actors §8.10](../spec-notes/actors.md))

    Tried 2026-11-01 (o12_coyote at 650 units; o13_coyote, a walk from 1,500 that did not
    move the player): the coyote neither warned nor charged; it was in combat for a few
    loops, then OnCombatEnd, GetAnimAction 1 for about 0.9 s [observed]. Next try: place
    the player by MoveTo steps from 1,200 to 300 units instead of a walk.
## Added 2026-10-31 (robots' talking lights, issue #1081)

59. **What sets a robot's `Talking` sequence while it speaks** (P3: Victor, Yes Man, Mr.
    House's screen, protectrons). NVForever plays `talking.kf` while a line is said with
    the sequence's time taken from the line's `.lip` (the widest mouth shape now, 0 to 1
    of the 0.17 s), so Victor's chest light (`##VoiceBox_talk:0`) flickers with the
    words and goes dark between lines (lipsync.md §6.1). To check: Goodsprings, talk to
    Victor (VictorREF 0x00103DFE) and record his chest light frame by frame over one
    line; compare its brightness with the `.lip`'s mouth weights and with the sound's
    loudness over the same frames (a pause between words, a long vowel). Does it go
    dark in pauses, follow the loudness or the mouth shapes, or loop by itself? Same on
    Mr. House's screen (`##TalkButtons:0`). ([lipsync §6.1](../spec-notes/lipsync.md))

## Added 2026-10-31 (Observe Combat spectators running away, issue #960)

60. **How close a fight comes before a spectator runs, and what it does then** (P3: the
    806 packages with Observe Combat [observed: esm-audit-2026-10-25.md]; the wiki says
    only "run away if they get too close"). NVForever runs a spectator from the nearest
    fighter within 600 units [design: stand-in], by the combat flee's spot search, out
    of a combat state, and brings it back to its package once no fighter is within
    1,500 (packages.md §7.6b). To check: Goodsprings by day, Easy Pete (EasyPeteRef) on
    his own package, the player in god mode starting a fight with a placed cazador
    (`PlaceAtMe NVCrCazador`) at about 1,200 units from Pete, then backing towards Pete
    in steps of about 100 units every few seconds. Sample every game loop: the distance
    from Pete to the player and to the cazador, Pete's `GetCurrentAIProcedure`,
    `GetCurrentAIPackage`, combat state (`IsInCombat`, `GetCombatTarget`) and
    `IsWeaponOut`, and his position. At what distance does he set off, from whom (the
    player or the cazador), how far does he go (a door, cover, straight away), does he
    turn to watch from there, and does he go back to his package when the fight ends or
    only later? ([packages §7.6b](../spec-notes/packages.md))

    Tried 2026-11-01 (o12_spectator, o13_town pete): not settled. In the second run Easy
    Pete had **no package** at noon (GetCurrentPackage none, procedure 0) and did nothing
    with a cazador 354 units off; in the first the cazador spawned beside him. Next try:
    an NPC read to be on an Observe Combat package first.
## Added 2026-10-31 (melee knockback, issue #1070)

61. **How far a melee blow pushes a living actor, and for how long** (P2: every melee
    fight). NVForever reads the Melee Knockback Formula's force (fKnockbackDamageMult 10,
    fKnockbackDamageBase 50, fKnockbackAgilMult -0.008, fKnockbackAgilBase 1, at most
    fKnockbackForceMax 512) as a speed in units/s that falls evenly to rest over
    fKnockbackTime (1 s), so a blow pushes force / 2 units: a Sledgehammer blow of 14
    damage on Agility 5 pushes 57 units [design]. To check: in Goodsprings, hit a
    standing settler (Agility known) with a Sledgehammer, normal and power attack, from
    the front; sample its position every game loop for 1.5 s after the hit: the distance,
    how long it moves, and whether the speed falls off. The same with a deathclaw's
    swipe on the player (god mode). ([combat-rules, Knockback](../spec-notes/combat-rules.md))
    Deathclaw on the player 2026-11-01 (o12_reach, o13_airport deathclaw_long,
    nvfairport, god mode, 28 blows) [observed]: each pushed the standing player **15-27
    units** sideways (15 most often), still moving 1.0-1.8 s after the blow, 1-6 units up,
    never knocked down (GetKnockedState 0); one blow in the first run tossed the player
    65 units up (a one-off). God mode may change the damage the formula reads. The
    settler and Sledgehammer cases are still open.
62. **Does AddReputation with axis 2 or 3 stop the script, as SetReputation does?** —
    answered 2026-11-01 (o11_00, o11_05 on nvftest): **yes**, and RemoveReputation and
    AddReputationExact too: the call changes nothing and the script's next line does not
    run, in a function script and in VMS20 stage 100's result script (the betrayal
    entry: NCR fame +1 from the line before, Khans unchanged, StopQuest not run). The
    stage's Complete Quest flag still completes the quest. Ours now stops the same way
    (reputation.rs `write_axis`). (scripts.md §7.6, issue #1127)

## Added 2026-10-31 (UI tile tree T15a: the message box and the prompt from their files)

63. **What `screen()` reports, and `resolutionconverter` — Answered 2026-10-31**.
    Width is 960 × window width/height, height 960 and `resolutionconverter` 960 /
    window height [observed: hud_menus capture 2026-10-31, three window sizes:
    1280 x 720, 1920 x 1080 and 1280 x 1024]. The capture read `screen()` through
    copied traits. NVForever keeps those units gated on a switched-on T15 menu
    (`MessageMenu` or `QuantityMenu`); applying them unconditionally is a follow-up
    [design: preserve default play].
    ([menu-xml §4.2](../spec-notes/menu-xml.md), [message-menu §5a](../spec-notes/message-menu.md))
64. **The message box's and the prompt's code-set traits** (P2: every message box and
    stack prompt drawn from its file). Ours (`tiles::menus`): the list as wide as the
    widest button's text and 80, each row its text's height and 20, the box's width by
    its text, title and list, the empty title 0 high, the backgrounds' alpha 237, the
    meter's `user3`/`user4` 1 and 10 [hypothesis or design each].
    To check: with a message box of a title, two lines and three buttons open, GetUIFloat
    `MessageMenu/NOGLOW_BRANCH/MM_MainRect/width`, `…/MM_ButtonList/width`, `height`,
    `_highlight_y`, `_selected_height`, `…/MM_Title/height` (and again for a box without
    a title), `…/MM_Background/alpha`, the rows' `_y` and `height`
    (`…/MM_ButtonList/MM_Button:0` …); with the prompt open over a stack of 20,
    `QuantityMenu/NOGLOW_BRANCH/QM_MainRect/QM_AmountMeter/user0` … `user4`, and a
    screenshot of each at 1280 x 720.
    ([message-menu §5a](../spec-notes/message-menu.md), [barter-menu §7](../spec-notes/barter-menu.md))

    Message box answered 2026-11-01 (o11_01, nvftest, GetUIFloatAlt 30 frames after
    opening; the window's size as the owner's INI has it) [observed]; the prompt is
    still open:
    - `MessageBoxEx "<two lines>|Alpha|Beta|Gamma"` (no title): box (`MM_MainRect`)
      396 x 306, text 316 x 67, title 14 x 38 (the empty title keeps its room, as the
      2026-10-31 capture read), list 155 x 156, rows 118 wide and 52 high at `_y` 0, 52,
      104, `MM_Button:0` the **last** row (104), `MM_Button:3` absent (-999).
    - `ShowMessage CG03GoatQuestion01` (title "G.O.A.T. Question 1", a long text, four
      long buttons): box 700 x 603 (the file's `_MaxMenuWidth`), text 618 x 137, title
      264 x 38, list 620 x 383 (the box less 80), rows 583 wide (the list less 37),
      wrapped rows 87, 157, 52 and 87 high: one line 52 and each further line 35 more,
      as message-menu §5a's line pitch gives.
    - Both: `MM_Background` is the box × 1.1 wide and × 1.3 high (435.6 x 397.8;
      770 x 783.9) with alpha 193.8 (ours 237, already listed in §5a);
      `_selected_height` 52 and `lb_highlight_box` 51 high; `_highlight_y` 0 and 87 (a
      row was chosen by then, likely by the pointer at the window's middle, so this does
      not contradict §5a's "no row chosen when a box opens").
    So ours' row height (text + 20 = 52 for one line) and list = box − 80 hold; the
    background's size and alpha are to compare with ours.

## Added 2026-10-31 (follow-ups and choices, issue #964)

65. **What a line with both follow-ups and choices offers after its follow-up** (P2: 15
    lines of FalloutNV.esm, e.g. INFO 0x00158A3D of Topic056, whose choice Topic068 is
    otherwise never offered). NVForever passes over a follow-up with the Goodbye flag
    when the line has choices and offers the choices (Topic067, whose line is that
    Goodbye follow-up, and Topic068); other follow-ups are said first [design, issue
    #964]. To check: at Yes Man's final report (VStoryEventSecuritronsFort 1) pick
    Topic056 and record whether the conversation ends after the line (Topic067's
    goodbye said with no pick) or Topic067/068 are offered. A second sample: Arcade's
    Topic065 (0x0016338D, non-Goodbye Say Once follow-ups): is 0x00163380 said before
    the choices? ([dialogue §3.4](../spec-notes/dialogue.md))

66. **Does a quest's ResetQuest on itself stop it?** (P2, issue #1232.) o41 reset VMQ03aTimer
    from a job script. The Emergency Radio (VEFR01NCRGood2EmergencyRadio) calls ResetQuest
    on itself in its MenuMode and then sets iSpawnSupplyDelay; if that stopped it, the
    drop would not come. Use the radio (button 1) and read GetQuestRunning right after,
    and whether the drop arrives. Ours keeps a self-reset running. (scripts.md §5)

## Added 2026-10-31 (the note notice, issue #1163)

67. **Does the original name a note in the corner when a script gives it?** (P3: every
    AddNote and AddItem of a note in quest scripts.) NVForever shows its own corner line,
    "Note: <the note's name>", for every note the player gets the first time: picked up,
    taken from a container, AddItem, AddNote, a terminal's Add Note item
    [hypothesis for the script-given ones]. To check: with a note the player lacks,
    `AddNote` it from the console, then `player.AddItem` another; screenshot the top left
    after each, and note any sound. A picked-up note in the same way for comparison.
    (issue #1163, `Game::file_note`)

## Added 2026-11-01 (actors at their place on arrival, issue #1208)

68. **Where the destination's actors are on arrival** (P2, issue #1208). NVForever puts
    every actor not in the loaded area before a fast travel or a load door at the end of
    its package's walk (on its furniture, seated) behind the loading screen, and moves
    nobody that was loaded [hypothesis, packages.md §8]. To check, with nvf_capture
    recording position, current package and GetSitting just before and just after:
    (a) Goodsprings → Novac at 5am (Boone: at the dinosaur exactly, part-way, or within
    the package's radius?); (b) a fast travel to a marker a few metres away inside the
    loaded area (does anyone move?); (c) entering the Mojave Outpost (Cass) and the
    Prospector Saloon (the settler at the bar): GetSitting 3 on the first frame?

## Added 2026-11-01 (MCM's shorthands, issue #976)

69. **Where MCM's shorthands point** (P3, issue #976; menu-xml.md §8 item 11, §10).
    NVForever reads `GetMCMFloat child grandchild` as the `MCM` rect's children counted
    from 1 in file order, 0 stopping at the level above [hypothesis, from MCM's files],
    while its `*:N` counts from the last child [observed on the HUD]. With MCM and one
    MCM mod installed, its page open and the pointer on the first row: GetUIFloat
    `StartMenu/MCM/*:1/*:1/_optionID`, GetUIFloat
    `StartMenu/MCM/MCM_Options/Option1/_optionID`, `GetMCMFloat 1 1 "_optionID"` and
    `GetMCMFloat 1 0 "_optionID"`.

## Added 2026-11-01 (Speech Successes and Failures, issue #967)

70. **Do New Vegas skill checks count Speech Successes / Speech Failures** (P3, issue
    #967). NVForever counts stat 12 when the player picks a Speech check's pass line
    and stat 31 for its fail line, and nothing for checks of other skills or perks
    [hypothesis: by the stats' names; `Game::choose`, misc-stats.md §3]. To check, with
    nvf_capture reading `GetPCMiscStat "Speech Successes"` and `"Speech Failures"` just
    before and after each choice: (a) one Speech check passed and one failed (Primm or
    Goodsprings, e.g. a [Speech 35] line with Speech above and below it); (b) one
    Barter or Science check passed and failed (do they move either stat?); (c) one perk
    line (e.g. [Lady Killer]). If (a) moves nothing, the count goes; if (b) moves them,
    other skills count too.

## Added 2026-11-01 (combat groups, issue #972)

71. **Does a fighter keep a hidden target while a member of its group detects it?** (P2,
    issue #972). NVForever keeps a target neither lost nor forgotten while a comrade in
    Combat with the same target detects it [hypothesis, combat-groups.md §3, from
    observer-jip-audit §3.3: five Fiends fought a hidden player for half an hour while
    often only 1 or 2 detected it]. To check, with nvf_capture recording IsInCombat,
    GetCombatTarget and GetDetected/GetDetectionValue against the player for each Fiend
    at Cook-Cook's camp: (a) the player hidden from all of them for over 15 s (does every
    Fiend drop out of combat, and when?); (b) one Fiend kept detecting the player (a
    TestDetection placement, or the player in its sight only): do the others that do not
    detect it stay in combat past 15 s? Also: does an alarmed townsperson that has not
    seen the first Ganger (GSPG03Ref) still name it in OnStartCombat (combat-groups.md §2)?

## Added 2026-11-01 (a conversation with nothing left to offer, issue #1113)

72. **Does a conversation close when the actor has no topic left?** (P3; mq-walkthrough §10
    stall 4.) Cold, Cold Heart: tell Sergeant Kilborn at the Mojave Outpost about Nipton
    (vNiptonVulpesvMojaveNCRTrooperTopic003, INFO 0x00138E1A: no Goodbye flag, no choices;
    its end script sets vNiptonVulpes 100, which stops the quest). Every line Kilborn has
    as a fixed speaker is vNiptonVulpes' [observed: `fnvtool dialogue lines --speaker
    vMOSgtKilborn`], and talked to again he greets with 0x001754C6 and offers nothing.
    NVForever closes the conversation when the line ends (dialogue.md "When a line ends":
    with nothing to offer the conversation ends [hypothesis]). Does the original close it,
    or does the menu stay open with nothing but a way out?

## Added 2026-11-01 (the pause column MCM waits for, issue #976 T11)

73. **The pause column's code-written traits** (P3, issue #976 T11; ui-tile-tree-tasks.md
    T11). MCM's script shows MCM only when `GetUIFloat
    "StartMenu/NOGLOW_BRANCH/main_container/childcount"` is 8, and places its trigger from
    main_container's `x`, `y`, `width` and `_alpha`, all written by the game's code (the
    file leaves them unset). NVForever's pause column is hand-built and writes none of
    them; no rule is guessed. In the original, with the pause menu open (no MCM), and
    again from the main menu: GetUIFloat `StartMenu/NOGLOW_BRANCH/main_container/childcount`,
    `…/x`, `…/y`, `…/width`, `…/_alpha`, `…/_enabled`, and `StartMenu/_isPauseMenu`; then
    the same with the Settings page open.
