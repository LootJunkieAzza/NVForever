# Tweaks

The settings page's **Tweaks** tab: optional changes to how the game plays or what it
shows, each off (or at "no change") unless the player sets it. The owner asked for
the features of Stewie's Tweaks, a script-extender plugin for the original, as engine
settings (2026-11-08, #1891).

## Sources and clean room

- [documented: Stewie Tweaks v9.87, its readme and its menu list `AllTweaks.json`, a private
  copy in the owner's `C:\fnv-private\stewietweaks`] say what each tweak does. Only
  that is used: the plugin's DLL is not opened, and none of its files or text are copied.
  The labels and notes of the Tweaks tab are NVForever's own words. The catalogue below
  names each tweak by its INI key, so a player who knows the plugin can find it.
- [documented: Viva New Vegas's generated `nvse_stewie_tweaks.ini`, the owner's
  modlist] says which tweaks that modlist turns on (the "VNV on" column); those go
  first in later batches.

## What is left out

- **Fixes** (the plugin's Fixes category): workarounds for the original's bugs. The
  owner: "if there are any fixes for the engine skip them we dont need fixes". NVForever
  is its own engine and does not carry those bugs over.
- **n/a**: about the original program, not about play: its error log, its keyboard
  handling, its achievements, its main menu's Downloads button, mod-author debug prints,
  the plugin's own performance work (its "inline vanilla functions" option is not even in
  the menu list).
- **unsure, skipped**: needs the plugin's own menu files or another mod's files, or the
  readme does not say clearly enough what changes to build it without guessing. Each says
  why. These wait for an owner decision or an observation.

## How it is built

- `fnv_game::tweaks::Tweaks`: the values the game's rules read (`Game::tweaks`), e.g.
  the experience multiplier in `experience::award`, power armour training in the
  frame's `set_power_armor_training`. Not saved with a game: settings.
- `nvf_play::tweaks::TweakSettings`: every value, with the game's part inside; the engine's
  modules read the rest (the karma messages in `crime`, the fast-travel refusals in
  `pipboy::data::travel`, the quest lines in `quest_messages::Hidden`, the XP meter).
  `sync` hands the game's part to the running game each frame, as the difficulty is
  handed over, and pushes the quest-line choices into `QuestMessages`.
- Each tweak is a row of the Tweaks tab, kept in `NVForever.ini` `[Settings]` under a
  `tweak-…` key (`crate::settings`). A switch is `switch!`; a multiplier is a slider
  from x0 to x2 in tenths, x1 in the middle.
- A tweak's options (the plugin's sub-settings) are added as rows of their own only
  when they change what the tweak does in a way a player would choose; the first batch
  keeps each tweak to one row and says in the catalogue which options are not built.

## First batch (2026-11-08)

| Row | INI key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Experience Earned (x0–x2) | `bReduceXP` | `fnv_game::experience::award`, after the perks |
| Quiet Experience | `bNoXPMessages` | `xp_meter::watch`: a gain that earns no level is not shown; LEVEL UP still is |
| Quiet Karma | `bNoKarmaMessages` | `crime::show_notes` |
| No Quest Failed Banner | `bNoQuestFailedPopup` | `QuestMessages::push` |
| No Location Banner | `bNoLocationPopup` | `QuestMessages::push` (the place is still discovered and its XP given) |
| No Objective List | `bRemoveQuestObjectiveAddedText` | `QuestMessages::push` |
| No Fast Travel | `bDisableFastTravel` | `travel::tweak_checks`: refused with the script block's text |
| Fast Travel in the Air | `bMidairFastTravel` | `travel::tweak_checks` |
| Fast Travel Near Enemies | `bFastTravelWithEnemiesNearby` | `travel::tweak_checks` (combat itself still refuses) |
| Fast Travel Encumbered | `bFastTravelOverencumbered` | `travel::tweak_checks` |
| Power Armor Without Training | `bPowerArmorNeedsNoTraining` | `Game` frame tick and `SetPCCanUsePowerArmor` |
| No Red Crosshair | `bNoRedCrosshairOnEnemies` | `hud_target::aim` (`AimHostile`, read by both HUDs) |
| No Enemies on the Compass | `bHideEnemyMarkers` | `compass::gather` |
| Quiet Reputation | `bNoReputationMessages` | `reputation::watch` |
| No Battle Music | `bDisableCombatMusic` | `music::play` |
| No Loading Tips | `bDisableLoadingScreenTips` | `loading::spawn_screen` (`Loading::hide_tips`) |
| No Explosion Blur | `bDisableExplosionInFaceIMOD` | nvforever `shot_fx::explosions` |
| No Chem Wore-Off Effect | `bRemoveChemWarnOffIMOD` | `Game::drug_wore_off` |
| Sleep in Owned Beds | `bSleepInOwnedBeds` | `wait::refusal` |

Already so, no row added: `bNoDialogueZoom` is the Gameplay tab's dialogue-zoom row;
NVForever never refuses a jump for being over-encumbered (`bJumpWhileOverencumbered`)
and its main menu's Quit asks nothing (`bNoExitConfirm`).

Options not built in this batch [design]: Quiet Karma's separate good/evil switches and
thresholds, Quiet Experience's per-source switches, the quest-failed "only if started"
option, Quiet Reputation's per-kind switches, the compass's "show enemies that fire"
option.

## Third batch (2026-11-08, Viva New Vegas's first)

| Row | INI key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| No Sneak Label | `bRemoveSneakLabel` | `hud::gather` and the tile HUD (`tiles`) |
| Skip Kill Camera | `bVatsExitKey` | `kill_cam::update`: a right click (Tab is the Pip-Boy here) |
| Number Keys on Terminals | `bNumberedComputerHotkeys` | `terminal::keys`: 1-9, 0 the tenth, outside the hacking page |
| Unassign Hotkeys | `bDeselectHotkeys` | `Hotkeys::clear_if_holding` from `hotkey_panel::assign_row` |
| Music While Talking (slider) | `bScaleMusicVolumeDuringDialogue` | `music::play`, in `PlayState::Dialogue` |
| Radio While Talking (slider) | `bScaleRadioSongVolumeDuringDialogue` | `radio::play`, in `PlayState::Dialogue` |
| Perks First When No Points | `bSkipSkillMenuIfNoPointsToAssign` | `levelup::sync` |
| No Message for Spent Books | `bNoSkillMessageIfIncreaseIsZero` | `script_events::effects` (`EffectCtx::tweaks`) |
| Recipe Categories in Capitals | `bCapitalizeRecipeCategories` | `crafting::view` |
| Rounds per Shot | `bShowWeaponAmmoUseInMenus` | `pipboy::items::info_of` (WEAP ammo use) |
| Skill Book Effects | `bShowBookEffects` | `pipboy::items::info_of` (the points with the perks applied) |
| Map Remembers Its Place | `bMapRemembersPosition` | `pipboy::data::opened` |
| Faster Hacking Exit | `bFasterHackingTransition` | `terminal::timers`: 0.5 s instead of 2 s |

## Fourth batch (2026-11-08)

| Row | INI key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Console Clicks Skip the Player | `bNonSelectablePlayerInConsole` | `console::click` |
| Holster in Real Time | `bPipboyLightAndHolsteringIgnoreTimescale` | `control::read_controls` (the light already counts real time) |
| No Screen Blood in Power Armor | `bPowerArmorPreventsScreenBlood` | `screen_splatter::take_hurts` |
| Invisible Foes Stay Hidden | `bHideRedCrosshairOnDistantInvisibleTargets` | `hud_target::aim` (Invisibility or Chameleon ≥ 1) |
| Quiet Landings in God Mode | `bGodmodePreventsLegCrippleSound` | `falls::hurt` |

## Fifth batch (2026-11-08)

| Row | INI key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Count Repeated Console Lines | `bCompressDuplicateConsoleMessages` | `Console::print` (`line -#n`) |
| Console Times | `bConsolePrintsIncludeTimestamp` | `Console::print` (`[mm:ss]` since the first line) |
| Living Anatomy Shows DR | `bLivingAnatomyShowDR` | `hud_target::aim`, `TargetHealth::anatomy_line` |
| Matching Categories | `bSynchronizeContainerCategories` | `MenuModel` `Category`/`SetCategory` (`sync_categories`) |

## Sixth batch (2026-11-08, gameplay)

| Row | INI key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Perks per Level (1–5) | `iPerksPerLevel` | `PerkSheet::of_player` |
| S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Points (30–70) | `bCustomSpecialPoints` | `SpecialSheet::for_menu` when no script set a total |
| Pick Any Lock | `bPickLocksWithoutSkill` | `lockpick::opening` (the skill asked of `may_pick`) |
| Hack Any Terminal | `bHackTerminalsWithoutSkill` | `terminal::opening` |
| No Terminal Lockout | `bNoLockFailedTerminals` | `terminal::hacked` |
| No Casino Bans | `bNoCasinoBans` | `casino::opening` |
| Search the Unconscious | `bLootUnconsciousVictims` | `activate::actor_action_in` |
| Pickpocket Worn Items | `bPickpocketWornItems` | `Game::pickpocket_worn` |
| No Sneak Criticals | `bNoSneakAttacksCriticals` | `combat::sneak_attack` |
| Reload Only When Empty | `bDisableReloadingNonEmptyClip` | `combat::fire` |
| Fast Travel Takes No Time | `bNoFastTravelTimeChange` | `travel::go` |
| Falls in Power Armor (x0–x2) | `bPowerArmorScalesFallDamage` | `falls::hurt` (`tweaks::wears_power_armor`) |

## Seventh batch (2026-11-08, weight)

| Row | INI key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Weightless Armor / Aid / Ammo / Weapons / Misc Items | `bWeightlessItems` | `fnv_sim::inventory::WeightRules::weightless` (bits), filled by `Game::sync_perk_weights` |
| Worn Armor Weighs Nothing | `bWeightlessWornArmor` | the same, for equipped armour |
| Worn Power Armor Weighs Nothing | `bWeightlessWornPowerArmor` | the same, for equipped power armour |

`WeightRules` is saved with the world; its new fields have serde defaults, so older
saves load, and the frame's sync sets them from the settings again.

## Eighth batch (2026-11-08, Action Points and refusals)

| Row | INI key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Action Points per Kill (0–50) | `bKillsRewardAP` | `Game` hit outcome, beside the kill XP |
| Action Points per Jump (0–50) | `bJumpingCostsAP` | `tweaks::ap_costs` (after the input, before physics) |
| Action Points per Second Running (0–20) | `bRunningCostsAP` | `tweaks::ap_costs` |
| No Travel on a Crippled Leg | `bNoFastTravelIfLegsCrippled` | `travel::answer`, `Refusal::CrippledLeg` (own text) |
| Wait Only When Seated | `bOnlyAllowWaitWhileSitting` | `wait::refusal`, `Refusal::NotSeated` (own text) |

Menu tweaks that code holding the game reads (the Pip-Boy's item info, crafting, the
level-up menu, the terminal's timers) are kept in `fnv_game::tweaks` too, so no system
needs another parameter; the catalogue's notes say where NVForever already does what a
tweak asks ("already so").

## Next

The "to do" rows, the ones Viva New Vegas turns on first. Not yet: reading a player's
own `nvse_stewie_tweaks.ini` as the starting values (it would need the INI read from the
game's Data folder, read-only).
