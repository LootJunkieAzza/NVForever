# Script function audit (2026-10-16)

The owner asked for every script function NVForever registers, or the shipped scripts use,
to behave as close to the original as the documentation allows. The trigger: `IsWeaponOut`
read state the engine set only for the player, so every NPC read 0. This audit hunts that
kind of gap ("the engine knows something the rules never hear") and functions that return a
constant where the original returns something live.

## 1. Method

- **Every registered function** (`crates/fnv-game/src/functions/mod.rs`: 398 rows
  below, some grouping several functions; 425 names including the console's): what state it
  reads, and who writes that state, by reading the implementation and grepping its writers
  in `crates/` and `engine/` (only the player? only tests? never the engine?).
- **Against the documentation**: the catalogue (`docs/spec-notes/script-functions-catalogue.md`,
  our wording of the GECK wiki, with call and condition counts over the ten masters), the
  owner's GECK wiki export (private), and decompiled shipped scripts (`fnvtool script
  decompile`) for who calls what. Tags as CLAUDE.md asks: [documented], [observed],
  [hypothesis].
- **In the original game** where the docs left the outcome open and the function matters:
  three batched, unattended captures with the `nvf_capture` plugin (§3).
- Status: **matches** (the documented or observed original), **fixed here**, **gap left**
  (reason in the note or §5), **open** (the docs do not settle it; §4 says what a capture
  needs), **stub** (`Kind::Stub`/`NoOp`; docs/design/script-stubs.md §4 has each one's
  reason).

Totals: 283 matches, 37 stub, 35 fixed here, 25 gap left, 18 open.

## 2. What was fixed

Ordered by use (calls / condition uses over the ten masters):

| Gap | Use | Fix | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| NPCs had nothing equipped (GetEquipped, GetWeaponAnimType, GetArmorRating, the weapon-health and weapon-type functions) | 76 / 479 + | NPCs put on outfit and weapon the first time their cell loads; PlaceAtMe actors at once (`fnv_sim::World::outfit`) | observed (Sunny Smiles, Ringo) |
| GetItemCount and GetEquipped ignored form lists | 737 / 1286 | sum / any member | documented |
| SetGhost had no effect | 357 | ghosts take no damage | documented |
| SetRestrained / SetUnconscious had no effect on movement | 281 / 199 | they stay where they are (fnv-ai) | documented / hypothesis |
| GetOpenState: DOOR only, never 2/4 | 178 / 4 | every object 1/3, actors 0, 2/4 from the engine's door animation | observed + documented |
| GetHasNote ignored carried notes | 167 / 277 | carried NOTE items count | observed |
| SetPos / SetAngle were overwritten | 148 / 50 | teleport / redraw / player travel | hypothesis (applied at once) |
| GetGameSetting of exe-only settings errored | 106 (135 iLockLevelMax* reads) | the game's values | observed |
| GetMapMarkerVisible gave no 2, never saw found markers | 41 / 31 | 0/1/2; found markers from the engine; ShowMap canTravel | documented + observed |
| GetLevel errored for NPCs | / 46 | the record's level | documented + observed |
| GetAnimAction stub (0 = "equipping") | 44 / 1 | −1 none, 0/1 drawing/holstering from the engine | observed |
| IsWeaponOut for NPCs not drawn | 19 / 51 | the draw rule moved into the rules crate | observed |
| GetHealthPercentage | 57 / 129 | the wiki's formula | documented |
| IsSneaking for unmeasured actors | 35 / 33 | `Game::sneaks` | documented |
| GetDayOfWeek 3 days off | 24 / 11 | days since Sunday 13 October 2281 | observed |
| AddPerk / HasPerk / RemovePerk forTeammates | 19 | the teammates' own list | documented |
| ResurrectActor, KillActor's cause, GetCauseofDeath | 515, 597 | heal and forget; the cause kept | documented / hypothesis |
| IsRunning while standing | / 4 | the player's speed mode | documented + observed |

Tests: `crates/fnv-game/tests/functions.rs` (`script_function_audit_fixes`,
`is_weapon_out_answers_for_undrawn_actors`, the calendar asserts),
`crates/fnv-game/tests/package_choice.rs` (weekday schedules), `crates/fnv-sim/tests/synthetic.rs`
(`an_npc_starts_with_its_outfit_and_weapon_equipped`), `crates/fnv-ai/tests/carry.rs`
(`a_restrained_actor_stays_in_place_until_released`); smoke `function-audit` (what the
engine tells: Ringo's weapon type, his weapon out after SetAlert, the player's run mode,
GetOpenState) and `script-stubs` (counts).

## 3. Captures run (original game, xNVSE 6.4.9, `nvf_capture`, save `nvftest`)

Jobs and outputs are private (`C:\fnv-private\capture\audit`, `...\out\fa_*.jsonl`).
All three ran unattended and ended; the game's saves were not changed.

| Job | What | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `fa_batch1_queries` | 60 read-only queries in the gas station: NPCs in an unloaded cell, the player, globals, settings | Sunny/Trudy GetEquipped 0 though carried (cell never loaded); GetWeaponAnimType Sunny 1, Trudy 0; GetLevel 2 / 5; GetDisposition 35 / 35; GetAnimAction −1; HasLoaded3D 0 far, 1 near; safe GetOpenState 3; Goodsprings marker GetMapMarkerVisible 2; player IsRunning 1 standing; GetDayOfWeek 5 on 25 Oct 2281 (GameMonth 9); iLockLevelMax* 0/25/50/75/100 (both quoted and bare names) |
| `fa_batch2_loaded_npcs` | MoveTo next to Sunny, then Trudy, then back | Sunny once loaded: GetEquipped 1/1, GetWeaponAnimType 5, GetArmorRating 10, GetCurrentAIPackage 6 (34 while unloaded), procedure 43, player.GetLineOfSight 1 at 41 units; all kept after leaving. Trudy never loaded at her spot (HasLoaded3D 0 within 1 unit): nothing learned |
| `fa_batch3_actions` | GetOpenState of nine objects, a holotape added, SetAlert on Ringo, KillActor on a far coyote | every object 3, Ringo 0; GetHasNote 1 / GetItemCount 0 after AddItem; Ringo GetWeaponAnimType 4, IsWeaponOut 0 → (3 frames: 0, GetAnimAction 0) → (180 frames: 1, GetAnimAction −1) → 0 after SetAlert 0; GetRestrained 1; GetIsGhost 1; KillActor on the unloaded coyote failed as a script step; its GetCauseofDeath alive read 0 |

## 4. Open: what a later capture batch needs

Round 2 (2026-10-17, docs/design/script-function-coverage.md §3) ran the unattended
group with the probe generator `tools/capture/function_probe.py`: GetDisposition, GetCauseofDeath,
HasLoaded3D, GetPCMiscStat and the leap day are settled; GetCurrentAIPackage's codes are
partly (Sandbox 36 agrees), GetSleeping on the player in the bed's menu reads 0. The
attended group below is still open.

Grouped so they can run together (the owner asked for batches). Jobs that need actions the
plugin cannot script (combat, walking an NPC through a door) are attended.

- **Unattended queries**: GetCurrentAIPackage codes (Sunny read 34 unloaded, 6 loaded; our
  numbering vs the original's for each package type); GetDisposition (35 for two NPCs with
  no modifier — base value and what moves it; the stub returns 0 and 15 conditions test it);
  GetCauseofDeath of a live loaded actor (−1 or 0?) and after KillActor with a cause on a
  loaded, non-essential actor; HasLoaded3D right after a cell load (how many frames);
  GetSleeping on the player in a bed; GetPCMiscStat "Locations Discovered" against found
  markers; GetDayOfWeek across 29 February 2284 (does the game have leap days?).
- **Attended**: GetActionRef/IsActionRef when an NPC opens a scripted door; IsInCombat of
  two hostile NPCs out of the player's detection reach; ResetAI on an actor in combat;
  GetCurrentAIProcedure at a Travel destination; IsInCriticalStage after a plasma crit kill;
  GetUnconscious and GetKnockedState of an essential knocked out by damage, and how long;
  GetIsID / IsInList on a PlaceLeveledActorAtMe actor.

## 5. Gaps left, with the reason

(Round 2 closed the terminal locks and RewardXP's levelling; the full status of every used
function, with the system each gap needs, is now docs/design/script-function-coverage.md.)

- ~~EquipItem / UnequipItem on NPCs are not drawn~~ (199 / 51 calls): fixed 2026-10-17.
  The engine now dresses and arms NPCs by what the rules have equipped
  (`fnv_sim::World::equipment`, engine/nvforever/src/outfits.rs) and redraws when that
  changes; combat's worn armour reads the same; smoke `npc-equip-drawn` [design]. NPCs
  whose cell the rules have not loaded keep the engine's own roll until they are.
- **SetUnconscious in the engine**: an unconscious actor does not lie down (ragdolls are
  for corpses only). (ResurrectActor's corpse is stood up again since
  docs/spec-notes/resurrect.md.)
- **GetKnockedState / GetUnconscious**: an essential knocked out by damage sets the same
  flag as SetUnconscious, never cleared; explosion knockdowns are rolled in the engine and
  not told.
- **GetAnimAction for attacks and reloads, and for the player**: the engine knows them
  (combat, nvf-play) but does not tell the rules.
- **IsMoving** gives no direction (2–4); **Look**'s rotate-body flag is kept, not acted on;
  **player.GetLineOfSight** reads 0 (the player is not a detector; 4 of 5 callers in
  FalloutNV.esm use it; the original said 1 at 41 units).
- **IsSpellTarget / HasMagicEffect / RemoveSpell** do not see NPC, creature and race
  abilities (SPLO) or enchantments on worn items: abilities are not applied at all.
- **Terminals** (GetLocked, GetLockLevel, Lock, Unlock): terminal locks live apart from the
  world's lock data (hacking.md §6).
- **GetChallengeCompleted** for kill challenges (only scripted challenges progress);
  **GetPCMiscStat** counters other than ModPCMiscStat's (4 calls); **MenuMode** 1 (the
  Pip-Boy, per the wiki example) and the loading codes; **SetScale** / **SetMinimalUse**
  not read by the engine; **SetPCCanUsePowerArmor** not read.
- **IsInCombat / GetDetected** for pairs out of the player's detection reach, and the player
  as detector: measured only near the player (performance choice of the engine).
