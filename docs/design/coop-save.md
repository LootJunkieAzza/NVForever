# Co-op players in saves (design)

Groundwork for a four-player co-op mode: a save keeps players 2–4 beside the game's own
player. Nothing plays them yet; the game and the engine keep what a save gave them and
write it into the next save unchanged. This is NVForever's own design, not a behaviour
of the original (which has one player) [design].

## 1. What is per player, what is shared

**Per player** (each of players 2–4 has its own copy; player 1 keeps the fields it had):

| Part | Player 1 (unchanged) | Players 2–4 (`fnv_game::coop::CoopPlayer`) |
|---|---|---|
| Actor: base form, cell, position, rotation, inventory (equipped items, condition, mods), S.P.E.C.I.A.L. the world holds, scale, equip locks | `sim.refs[0x00000014]` (`fnv_sim::world::RefState`) | `actor` (the same type) |
| Heading and view pitch | the save header's `place` | `heading_deg`, `pitch_deg` |
| Health and every other actor value (base, permanent and temporary modifiers, damage), dead, unconscious, factions, level | `extra[0x00000014]` (`RefExtra`) | `extra` (the same type) |
| Character: name, sex, look, race, level, XP, perks, tag skills and slots, skill points, need stages, misc statistics, kill counts, notes and holotapes, power armour training, Caravan cards | `player` (`PlayerState`) | `character` (`fnv_game::coop::Character`, those fields of `PlayerState`) |
| Magic effects active on the character (aid, abilities, worn enchantments, needs' and radiation effects) | `effects` with target the player | `effects` |
| Engine: first/third person and distance, sneak, always run, flashlight, magazine of the weapon in hand | `EngineSnapshot` | `EngineSnapshot::coop` (`nvf_play::save::CoopEngine`) |

**Shared** (saved once, as before): quests, script variables and instances, the world
(every other reference, globals, cells, form changes), dialogue topics and lines said,
reputation and crimes, factions the player is an enemy of, map markers and fast travel,
challenges, achievements, casino winnings and bans, the controls scripts disabled,
hardcore, the Pip-Boy radio and active quest, weather, time.

## 2. Format

All new fields are optional and absent in a one-player save, so the formats keep their
versions (`fnv.game.state/1`, `nvf.engine.state/1`, `nvf.save.header/1`): an older save
reads as one player, and a one-player save is byte-for-byte what it was.

- **Body, game part**: `GameSnapshot::coop`, a list of `CoopPlayer`, in slot order. Each
  has `slot` (2–4). A list naming a slot outside 2–4 or one slot twice fails the load
  (`fnv_game::coop::checked`).
- **Body, engine part**: `EngineSnapshot::coop`, a list of `CoopEngine` by the same slots.
- **Header**: `SaveHeader::coop`, `{slot, name, level}` per player, for the load list
  (filled from the body's characters when saving).

FormIDs in the new parts are written as everywhere else (`0x%08X` strings), so a save
loaded into another load order remaps them with the rest (`fnv_save::remap_json`); a
co-op player's effects of plugins no longer loaded are dropped
(`GameSnapshot::drop_gone`), and the magazines' weapons are remapped beside player 1's.

## 3. API (fnv-game)

- `Game::coop`: players 2–4 in slot order; `coop_player(slot)`, `set_coop_player(p)`
  (checks the slot), `remove_coop_player(slot)`.
- `CoopPlayer::copy_of_player(&game, slot)`: a player made as a copy of player 1 now (a
  starting point for a joining player, and the tests').
- Test: `coop_players_round_trip_apart_from_the_player` (crates/fnv-game/tests/synthetic.rs).

## 4. Left for the co-op mode

- References for players 2–4 in the world (so scripts, AI and combat can name them), and
  what `ActiveEffect::target` of a co-op player's effect is then: today it is written as
  it was taken (player 1's ID) and means that character.
- Moving a character between player 1 and a co-op slot (who hosts a loaded save).
- Whether any shared part should be per player after all (reputation, map markers,
  the active quest): an owner decision.
