# Discoverable Pip-Boy handle

[design] First functional gesture increment for #2436: an optional visible center-bottom
handle, a 48 logical-pixel hit area, and configurable upward travel. It requests the
existing `menu::OpenInventory` action only on a successful release. The normal menu
opener retains script-control locks, active-menu, wait and game-state admission.
No item, equip, fire or save action is emitted by this gesture.

[design] The handle stays above cached Android navigation/mandatory-gesture/cutout
insets, converted by display density to the window's logical coordinates. A read-only global-layout observer caches root insets without replacing normal
inset handling or installing a system-gesture exclusion.
The drawing follows vertical drag progress; short, horizontal, canceled, resized,
backgrounded, unfocused, text-captured or editor-owned gestures reset without opening.
Only an unclaimed start inside the handle is admitted. A start on a moved gameplay
button belongs to that button. A second finger cannot inherit the first finger's drag.

[design] The normal settings page persists `touch-pipboy-swipe-v1` (off by default)
and `touch-pipboy-distance-v1` (48–200 logical pixels in 4-pixel steps). Android logical
pixels are density-independent here. Existing layouts and bindings are unaffected.
The current global UI scale and custom button hit areas remain authoritative.

[design] Three pure routing tests and four real TouchControlsPlugin event-route tests
are authored for release-only commit, no fire/look leakage, repeated release,
horizontal/cancel/resize rejection, second-finger ownership, custom-button precedence,
and menu/suspend/focus/text/editor cancellation. They remain unrun. The fourth event-route regression retains focus loss across
frames until an explicit focus gain. Java compilation
against API35/JDK17 passed; deprecated API notes concern the API29-compatible inset
accessor. Rust parser and diff checks pass. Phone/rendered/native qualification is pending.

[design] This increment does not yet implement a quick tray, downward close, two-stage
tray/Pip-Boy mode, drag-to-assign, long-press item actions, sprint lock, gesture practice,
or experimental VATS gestures. These are approved subsequent increments. In particular,
VATS recognition must be per-screen, use a valid stable target and enter selection only;
it must never queue or fire a shot. Minigame/map two-finger actions own their contacts.

[design] Composition with the controller/aiming branch must cancel this drag on takeover,
preserve strong first-touch consumption, hide the handle with the gameplay overlay, and
use the combined `cancel_touch`/held-sneak release path on commit. The minigame/dialogue
adapters also need the central modal capture bridge before combined qualification.
Java `onCreate`/`onResume` additions must be combined with controller metadata lifecycle
hooks; neither listener nor reset generation may be lost. This source work stays out of
the corrective R4 APK.
