# Candidate CLI contract (Layer 1)

The parity lab runs `fnvtool` and compares its stdout (one JSON document) with oracle
goldens of the **same schema**. Any oracle tool (xEdit export script, independent
reader) must emit these shapes. Exit code 0 = success, 1 = input could not be processed,
2 = usage error (`--help` exits 0); diagnostics go to stderr. `fnvtool --help` and
`fnvtool <group> <command> --help` describe every option.

Conventions: FormIDs are strings `"0x%08X"` (upper-case hex) and are **file-local**
(exactly as stored in the plugin, not load-order adjusted). Text is decoded from
Windows-1252 to UTF-8. Missing optional values are `null`.

## `fnvtool esm inventory <plugin>` → `fnv.esm.inventory/1`

```json
{
  "schema": "fnv.esm.inventory/1",
  "plugin": "FalloutNV.esm",
  "header": {"plugin": "...", "is_master": true, "flags": 1, "version": 1.34,
             "num_records": 542016, "next_object_id": "0xFF17BA48", "author": "...",
             "description": null, "masters": [], "overridden_forms": 0,
             "other_subrecords": [], "file_size": 245650747},
  "errors": [],
  "records": [
    {"formid": "0x0017B37C", "type": "GMST", "edid": "sPoisonNoWeaponMessage",
     "full": null, "flags": 0, "form_version": 15}
  ]
}
```

`records` lists every record except TES4, in file order. `header.version` is the HEDR
f32 widened to a double without rounding (e.g. 1.340000033378601). `overridden_forms` is
the number of u32 entries in ONAM (0 when absent). `errors` entries are
`{"code": ..., "detail": ...}`; they are diagnostics and not compared. `edid`/`full` are the first
`EDID`/`FULL` subrecord read as NUL-terminated text. `flags` is the raw record-header
flags dword (including the compression bit 0x40000).

Lab comparator: **keyed** on `formid`, `select: "/records"`, fields
`["type", "edid", "full", "flags", "form_version"]` (the xEdit cross-check compares only
`type`, `edid`, `full`). Header compared separately with **exact** on `/header`,
including `file_size`.

## `fnvtool esm stats <plugin>` → `fnv.esm.stats/1`

```json
{"schema": "fnv.esm.stats/1", "plugin": "...", "records": 465017, "groups": 77000,
 "compressed_records": 33179, "deleted_records": 0, "hedr_num_records": 542016,
 "hedr_matches_records_plus_groups_minus_one": true, "top_groups": ["GMST", "..."],
 "by_type": {"ACHR": 3386, "...": 0}, "by_group_type": {"top": 101, "...": 0}}
```

`records` and `by_type` include TES4. `by_group_type` always lists all 11 group-type
names, in the order below, including zero counts; an out-of-range type N is counted under `unknown_N`. Group-type names: `top, world_children, interior_cell_block,
interior_cell_subblock, exterior_cell_block, exterior_cell_subblock, cell_children,
topic_children, cell_persistent_children, cell_temporary_children,
cell_visible_distant_children`.

## `fnvtool bsa list <archive> [--no-content-hash]` → `fnv.bsa.listing/1`

```json
{
  "schema": "fnv.bsa.listing/1",
  "archive": "Update.bsa",
  "header": {"version": 104, "archive_flags": 131, "file_flags": 283, "folder_count": 22,
             "file_count": 86, "total_folder_name_length": 645, "total_file_name_length": 1900},
  "warnings": [{"code": "...", "detail": "..."}],
  "errors": [],
  "files": [
    {"path": "meshes\\creatures\\nvsecuritron\\death.kf", "name_hash": "0x1776fd25640574e8",
     "folder_hash": "0x...", "stored_size": 2199, "compressed": false,
     "size": 2199, "sha256": "..."}
  ]
}
```

`path` is `folder\name` as stored (lower case, backslashes); when the folder name is
empty the path is the bare file name. `header.file_flags` is the low u16 only (the two
following bytes are not part of the contract). `size`/`sha256` describe the
decoded (decompressed) contents and are omitted with `--no-content-hash`. Lab comparator:
**keyed** on `path`, fields `["stored_size", "compressed", "size", "sha256", "name_hash"]`.

# Layer 2 (meshes, animations, textures)

Inputs are BSA archives; every `.nif` / `.kf` (or `.dds`) file inside is reported, in
archive order. Paths are as stored in the archive (lower case, backslashes). Floats are
f32 values widened to JSON numbers without rounding; NaN and infinities are `null`
(two node translations in the game are NaN). -0.0 and 0.0 compare equal. Block references
are block indices. `error` / `reason` texts are diagnostics: tools should agree on whether
one is present, and the lab compares them, but none occur in the game data.

## `fnvtool nif stats <archive>` → `fnv.nif.stats/1`

```json
{
  "schema": "fnv.nif.stats/1",
  "archive": "Fallout - Meshes.bsa",
  "files": [
    {"path": "meshes\clutter\x.nif", "version": "20.2.0.7", "user_version": 11,
     "bs_version": 34, "num_blocks": 12, "strings": 9,
     "block_types": {"BSFadeNode": 1, "NiTriStrips": 2, "...": 0}, "error": null}
  ]
}
```

Everything here comes from the file header (docs/spec-notes/nif.md §2), so it is defined
for every version. `strings` is the string-table entry count (`null` for versions without
a string table). `block_types` counts blocks per type name (keys sorted). `error` is a
message when the header cannot be read, and then the other fields are `null`. Lab
comparator: **keyed** on `path`, fields `["version", "user_version", "bs_version",
"num_blocks", "strings", "block_types", "error"]`.

## `fnvtool nif scene <archive>` → `fnv.nif.scene/1`

```json
{
  "schema": "fnv.nif.scene/1",
  "archive": "Fallout - Meshes.bsa",
  "skipped": [{"path": "...", "reason": "no block-size table (version 20.0.0.4)"}],
  "objects": [
    {"key": "meshes\clutter\x.nif#0", "type": "BSFadeNode", "name": "x", "parent": null,
     "translation": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "rotation": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
     "scale": 1.0}
  ],
  "shapes": [
    {"key": "meshes\clutter\x.nif#3", "type": "NiTriStripsData", "vertices": 24,
     "triangles": 30, "has_normals": true, "has_tangents": true, "uv_sets": 1,
     "has_vertex_colors": false, "bound_center": [0.0, 0.0, 1.5], "bound_radius": 3.2,
     "aabb_min": [-1.0, -1.0, 0.0], "aabb_max": [1.0, 1.0, 3.0]}
  ]
}
```

Only files with a block-size table are analysed; the others are listed in `skipped` (and
also files whose container cannot be read). `key` is `path#block`.

- `objects`: every block whose type is NiNode, a type derived from it (spec notes §3), or
  NiTriShape, NiTriStrips, BSSegmentedTriShape, in block order. `name` is the object name
  (`null` for "no string"). `parent` is the index of the first node (lowest block index)
  whose child list contains this block, else `null`. `rotation` is row-major.
- A file in which any block cannot be decoded is listed in `skipped` and contributes no
  objects or shapes.
- `shapes`: every NiTriShapeData and NiTriStripsData block. `vertices` is the stored vertex
  count. `has_tangents` means tangents are actually stored (normals present and the
  tangent bit set). `triangles` = triangle count
  if the has-triangles byte is set (lists), or the sum over strips of
  max(length − 2, 0) if the has-points byte is set (strips), else 0. `uv_sets` = the
  number of UV sets actually stored. `aabb_min`/`aabb_max` = component-wise min/max over
  the stored vertices (`null` when there are none).

Lab comparator: **keyed** on `key` for `/objects` and for `/shapes` (all fields), plus
**exact** on `/skipped`.

## `fnvtool nif nodes <sources…> --schema s [--examples 3] [--values 20]` → `fnv.nif.nodes/1`

```json
{
  "schema": "fnv.nif.nodes/1",
  "sources": ["Fallout - Meshes.bsa", "Update.bsa"],
  "files": 19277,
  "undecoded_blocks": 0,
  "skipped": [{"path": "...", "reason": "..."}],
  "block_types": [{"name": "NiNode", "files": 4271, "count": 38714, "types": {}, "values": [], "examples": ["meshes\\..."]}],
  "node":     [{"name": "ProjectileNode", "files": 218, "count": 221, "types": {"NiNode": 221}, "values": [], "examples": []}],
  "object":   [],
  "other":    [],
  "extra":    [{"name": "Prn", "files": 466, "count": 466, "types": {"NiStringExtraData": 466}, "values": [["Weapon", 190]], "examples": []}],
  "text_key": [{"name": "Eject", "files": 86, "count": 86, "types": {"NiTextKeyExtraData": 86}, "values": [], "examples": []}]
}
```

For finding names the engine never reads (docs/spec-notes/nif-node-audit.md). Each list is
sorted by `files` (how many files have the name), then by name; `count` is how many
blocks. `node`: names of blocks derived from NiNode; `object`: other NiAVObjects (shapes,
lights, cameras, particle systems); `other`: other named NiObjectNETs (properties,
controllers); `extra`: NiExtraData names with their string, integer or float values (the
`--values` most common); `text_key`: every NiTextKeyExtraData key text. `examples` keeps
the first `--examples` paths. A key list (`node`, `object`…) is absent when nothing has
that kind. Not used by the lab.

## `fnvtool dds list <archive>` → `fnv.dds.listing/1`

Defined in docs/spec-notes/dds.md together with the texture notes.

## `fnvtool spt list <archive>` → `fnv.spt.listing/1`, `fnvtool spt dump <source> [--path p]` → `fnv.spt.dump/1`

SpeedTree parameter files (docs/spec-notes/speedtree.md). `list`: one row per `.spt` in
the archive: `path`, `entries`, `seed`, `bark_texture`, `levels`, `leaf_maps`,
`leaf_uvs`, `generated` (`vertices`, `triangles`, `leaves`, `top`, `width` of NVForever's
generated tree at size 1), `error` (`null`, or the parse error with only `path` and
`entries` beside it). `dump`: `summary` (a `list` row) and `entries`: every entry in
file order as `tag`, `offset`, `value` (`null` for markers, a number for u8, `{u32, f32}`
for 4-byte payloads, a string, a float array, or an array of 8-float arrays for 10002).
Not compared by the lab (no golden).

# Layer 3 (world data)

All `world` commands take the Data folder, the plugins in load order, and
`--schema <schemas/fnv>`; they print the load order back as `load_order`. FormIDs are
**load-order (global) FormIDs** as `"0x%08X"`: the top byte is the index of the defining
plugin in the given load order (docs/spec-notes/esm.md). Floats are f32 values widened to
JSON numbers. Facts behind the fields: docs/spec-notes/world.md.

A cell's references are the records in persistent (8), temporary (9) and
visible-distant (10) cell-children groups labelled with that cell, except LAND and NAVM.
When several plugins define the same reference FormID, the last one in load order wins,
including which cell's group it is in. The same rule picks the cell's LAND.

## `fnvtool world refs ... (--cell <edid|formid> | --world <edid|formid> [--x X --y Y] | --interiors)` → `fnv.world.refs/1`

Selects one cell (`--cell`, or `--world` with `--x/--y` for an exterior grid cell), every
cell of a worldspace (`--world` alone, its persistent cell included), or every interior
cell (`--interiors`).

```json
{
  "schema": "fnv.world.refs/1",
  "cells": [
    {"formid": "0x0000ABCD", "edid": "Goodsprings", "name": null, "world": "0x000DA726",
     "grid": [-18, 0], "interior": false, "water_height": 3.4028234663852886e38,
     "refs": 159, "land": "0x0000ABCE"}
  ],
  "refs": [
    {"formid": "0x00012345", "type": "REFR", "cell": "0x0000ABCD", "base": "0x00012300",
     "base_type": "STAT", "base_edid": "Rock01", "model": "meshes\rocks\rock01.nif",
     "position": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], "rotation": [0.0, 0.0, 1.5707964], "scale": 1.0,
     "flags": 0, "persistent": false, "initially_disabled": false, "deleted": false,
     "enable_parent": null}
  ]
}
```

Membership: a cell belongs to a worldspace when its winning CELL record sits inside that
worldspace's world-children group (type 1; the label is the WRLD FormID, local to the
plugin); interior cells are inside no world-children group. The persistent cell is the
CELL directly inside the world-children group (not inside a block group).

- `cells` sorted by `formid`; `refs` = the references of all selected cells, sorted by
  `formid`. `cell` = the cell whose group holds the winning definition.
- `type` = record signature of the winning definition.
- `base` = NAME mapped to the load order (`null` if absent or 0). `base_type`, `base_edid`
  come from the base's winning record; `null` when the base is not defined in the load
  order (engine-defined forms). `model` = the base's MODL with surrounding whitespace
  removed, `null` if that leaves it empty; otherwise ASCII letters lower-cased, `/` → `\`,
  leading `\` removed (TREE models are stored as e.g. `\WastelandShrub01.spt`), then
  prefixed with `trees\` if it ends in `.spt` (SpeedTree), else with `meshes\`, unless it
  already starts with that prefix.
- `position`, `rotation` = DATA (rotation in radians, as stored); `[0,0,0]` if DATA is
  absent. `scale` = XSCL, else 1.0. `flags` = record header flags of the winning
  definition; `initially_disabled` = bit 0x800, `deleted` = bit 0x20. `persistent` = the
  winning definition is in a type 8 group.
- `enable_parent` = XESP as `{"ref": formid, "opposite": bool (flag bit 0)}`, else `null`;
  the reference FormID is mapped like `base` (a null reference gives `null` for the whole
  field).
- Cell fields come from the winning CELL record: `edid` (EDID), `name` (FULL), `world`,
  `water_height` = XCLW (`null` if absent), `grid` = XCLC (x, y) or `null`, `interior` =
  DATA bit 0, `refs` = number of references whose winning definition is in this cell,
  `land` = the cell's LAND FormID or `null`.
- Field layouts: docs/spec-notes/world.md §5.

Lab comparator: **keyed** on `formid` for `/refs` and for `/cells` (all fields).

## `fnvtool world heights ... --world <edid|formid>` → `fnv.world.heights/1`

```json
{
  "schema": "fnv.world.heights/1",
  "world": "0x000DA726",
  "cells": [
    {"grid": [-18, 0], "min": 4012.0, "max": 4410.0, "mean": 4201.37,
     "corners": [4012.0, 4100.0, 4300.0, 4410.0], "centre": 4200.0}
  ]
}
```

One entry per exterior grid cell of the worldspace whose LAND has VHGT, sorted by
(x, y). The worldspace's persistent cell (the CELL directly in the world-children group)
is not a grid cell. Heights are the 33 × 33 integrated VHGT values in world units
(world.md §3); `corners` = [south-west, south-east, north-west, north-east] =
h[0][0], h[0][32], h[32][0], h[32][32] with h[row][col], rows south → north;
`centre` = h[16][16]; `mean` is the mean of all 1089 values.

Lab comparator: **keyed** on `grid` for `/cells` (all fields, float tolerance 1e-3).

## Other world commands (not yet scenarios)

- `world list` → `fnv.world.list/1`: per worldspace FormID, EDID, name, parent, persistent
  cell, cell / grid-cell / land-cell / reference counts, grid bounds, default heights;
  interior cell count; orphan groups; unreadable records.
- `world cells [--world W]` → `fnv.world.cells/1`: the cell objects above, for one
  worldspace or (without `--world`) all interior cells.
- `world land --world W --x X --y Y [--full]` → `fnv.world.land/1`: the 33 × 33 heights
  (rows south → north); with `--full` also normals (signed), colours and texture layers.
- `world check [--world W]` → `fnv.world.check/1`: the observational checks behind
  world.md (cell membership of references, shared LAND edges, normals against heights,
  base object types).
- `world audio [--cell C [--at x,y,z] [--hour H]]` → `fnv.world.audio/1`: `counts` of
  music types, media sets by type, controllers and acoustic spaces, `music_types` and
  `acoustic_spaces` (each with its reverb environment, ASPC `ANAM`, and interior flag).
  Without `--cell`: `world`, statistics of every audio marker and sound marker of the load
  order. With `--cell`: `cell` (music type, acoustic space with its sounds) and
  `audio_markers`, `controllers` and `sound_markers` in earshot (the whole worldspace for
  an exterior cell). With `--at`: `at`, the marker, set, layers and files chosen there
  at `--hour` (default 12), the background loop and the sound markers in reach
  (docs/spec-notes/audio.md §4–6).
- `world radio [--functions F]` → `fnv.world.radio/1`: `counts` (talking activators by
  header flags, placed station references by broadcast range, receivers by script, the
  stations' lines and song files, stations on the Pip-Boy), `stations` (with `on_pipboy`
  and each placed reference's `broadcasts_from`), `receiver_bases` (with their placed
  references) and `goodsprings_receivers`; no texts (docs/spec-notes/radio.md §7).
- `world terminals [--functions F]` → `fnv.world.terminals/1`: terminal records by hacking
  difficulty, flag, server; menu items with scripts, notes, sub menus and conditions (by
  run-on and function); placed terminals by level with examples; no texts
  (docs/spec-notes/hacking.md §1).
- `world hack <DATA_DIR> [--difficulty 0-5] [--science N] [--seed N] [--pick I,…]` →
  `fnv.world.hack/1`: one hacking game from the game's word list: `word_count`,
  `password`, `words` with their likeness, `pairs`, the 17 `rows` as the screen shows them,
  and the `picks` and `log` after the picked dump indices (hacking.md §2–5). Prints words of
  the game's word list: for the owner's console, not for committed files.

## `fnvtool phys ...` (Layer 4 physics)

`phys cell` (`fnv.phys.cell/1`: the physics world around a cell and probe characters
dropped in it), `phys walk` (`fnv.phys.walk/1`: a scripted character walk traced step by
step), `phys heights` (`fnv.phys.heights/1`: terrain height under fixed points of every
landscape cell, parity lab `L4.phys.heights.*`) and `phys terrain` (`fnv.phys.terrain/1`:
terrain colliders checked against the LAND heights of a worldspace). Their contract lives
in docs/spec-notes/physics.md §7.

# Layer 4 (collision geometry)

`fnvtool collide ragdoll` (`fnv.collide.ragdoll/1`, observational: the jointed bodies of
skeletons) is described in docs/spec-notes/ragdoll.md §5.
`fnvtool collide objects` (`fnv.collide.objects/1`) and `fnvtool collide survey`
(`fnv.collide.survey/1`) are defined in docs/spec-notes/collision.md §5 together with the
collision notes.

# Layer 4 (core simulation)

`fnvtool sim containers` (`fnv.sim.containers/1`), `fnvtool sim run`
(`fnv.sim.actions/1` → `fnv.sim.trace/1`), `fnvtool sim forms` (`fnv.sim.forms/1`) and
`fnvtool sim doors` (`fnv.sim.doors/1`) are defined in docs/spec-notes/simulation.md §7
together with the simulation notes.

`fnvtool sim door-models <data_dir> <plugin>... --schema <dir> [--nif-schema <dir>]`
(`fnv.sim.door_models/1`): every DOOR base with `door`, `edid`, `model`, `flags` (FNAM),
`open_sound`/`close_sound`/`loop_sound` (SNAM/ANAM/BNAM), its placed references (`refs`,
`teleport_refs`, `in_cell_refs`, `in_cell_with_lock`, `in_cell_open_by_default`), its
model's `sequences` (`name`, `start`, `stop`, `cycle_type`, `tracks`, `text_keys` as
`[time, text]`), `bodies` (collision objects counted by motion and layer, and for
keyframed bodies of Open/Close models whether the end of Close equals the stored pose
and whether the end of Open moves them) and `error`; `summary` aggregates them
(`by_sequence_names`, `text_keys_by_sequence`, `durations`, `cycle_types`,
`rigid_bodies`, `flags`). Notes: docs/spec-notes/doors.md.

# Layer 5 (compiled scripts)

`fnvtool script units` (`fnv.script.units/1`), `script decode` (`fnv.script.decode/1`),
`script decompile` (`fnv.script.decompile/1`, parity lab `L5.script.decode`) and
`script coverage` (`fnv.script.coverage/1`) are defined in docs/spec-notes/scripts.md §3.5
together with the bytecode notes.

`fnvtool script run <data_dir> <plugin>... --schema <dir> --actions <file>`
(`fnv.script.actions/1` → `fnv.script.trace/1`, parity lab `L5.quest.*`) follows the
contract in docs/spec-notes/layer5-captures.md §4; the operations beyond it (headless
stand-ins for Layer 6) and the trace's `events` and `final` are in
docs/spec-notes/scripts.md §8. `script coverage` fills `implemented` and `stub` per opcode
and reports the intro chain's coverage (scripts.md §7).

# Dialogue (Layer 6, steps D1 and D2)

`fnvtool dialogue topics` (`fnv.dialogue.topics/1`), `dialogue lines`
