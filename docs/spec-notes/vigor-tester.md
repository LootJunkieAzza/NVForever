# Spec note: the Vigor Tester (S.P.E.C.I.A.L. menu)

Tags as in `nif.md`: `[documented]` cites a page or file, `[observed]` says what was
looked at, `[hypothesis]` is a reading that nothing has confirmed yet. `[design]` marks
what is NVForever's own. Implementation: `engine/nvf-play/src/chargen/vigor.rs` (opening,
keys, clicks, drawing), `chargen/vigor/model.rs` (pages, controls, which part shows
what), `chargen/vigor/view.rs` (where the machine sits before the camera); the rules
(40 points, 1 to 10, Done only at 0 left) are `crates/fnv-game/src/chargen.rs`
`SpecialSheet`.

## 1. Sources

- **Six screenshots from the owner**, 2026-10-11 (1280 × 720, kept privately): the
  review page at 05, 02 and 00 points remaining, and the Strength, Charisma and Agility
  pages at 05 points to go. The owner: every attribute starts at 5 with 5 more to give
  out; an attribute goes no lower than 1 and no higher than 10; every point must be
  given out before going on.
- **The menu file** `menus\chargen\love_tester_menu.xml` (`Fallout - Misc.bsa`; read,
  not shipped).
- **The models** in `Fallout - Meshes.bsa`, `meshes\architecture\goodsprings\`:
  `nv_vitomaticvigortester_activate.nif`, `…_cabinet.nif`, `…_cabinet02.nif`; their
  textures in `Fallout - Textures.bsa` / `Textures2.bsa`
  (`textures\architecture\goodsprings\nv_vigor-tester_*`,
  `textures\terminals\english\vitomatic_page_0…4.dds`, `vitomatic_special-values1/2.dds`,
  `textures\terminals\BBNumber0…10.dds`, `BBIncrease/DecreaseOff/On.dds`,
  `BBLT/RTOff/On.dds` and the `pc\`, `xbox\`, `ps3\` variants of the last two).
- **The records**: ACTI `VCG01VigorTester` (0x00104C0A, "Vit-o-matic Vigor Tester")
  has the model `architecture\Goodsprings\NV_VitoMaticVigorTester_Cabinet02.NIF`
  [observed: `fnvtool esm decode`].

## 2. The menu file [documented: love_tester_menu.xml]

- Menu `LoveTesterMenu`, class `&LoveTesterMenu;`, no click past, alpha 0, a menu fade of
  0.25 s.
- Pad bindings: RT → `next_page`, LT → `previous_page`, right → `increase_value`, left →
  `decrease_value` (both repeat while held, `repeathorizontal`), up → `index_up`, down
  → `index_down`, X → `exit_menu` (whose own button is A).
- The named parts are invisible click targets with placeholder positions and no
  picture: `next_page`, `previous_page`, `increase_value`, `decrease_value`,
  `exit_menu`, the two 1 × 1 hot rectangles `index_up`/`index_down`, and a
  1600 × 1200 hot rectangle `clickable` over the whole screen. Everything seen is
  drawn by the menu's class from the 3D model [hypothesis: clicks land on the model's
  buttons through the full-screen `clickable`].
- No key of the PC is named. The keys NVForever gives the menu are [design] (§6).

## 3. The models [observed: the decoded files]

The three files share one frame: +z up, the machine's front towards +y, the screen's
right is −x.

- **`…_cabinet02.nif`**: the placed activator. Cabinet, glass, bulbs, and a fixed
  poster shape with `vitomatic_page_0.dds` and blank label boards.
- **`…_cabinet.nif`**: the cabinet without glass or poster, the ten bulbs
  `P1_PointVal_01…10` (`:2` the socket, `:3` the bulb with the numbers, lit by the
  per-pixel shader with an environment map) and, per bulb, two glow shapes
  `P1_PointVal_<nn>_GLOW:4` (an additive sprite, `textures\effects\fxparttinyglowy.dds`)
  and `:5` (the bulb again, unlit, white emissive × 1.125). No record names this file
  [observed for the vigor tester's ACTI; not searched further]: it is taken to be the
  menu's [hypothesis: it has what the menu needs and the placed one does not].
- **`…_activate.nif`** (8,516 blocks, 229 animated nodes): the moving parts.
  - Label boards, ten per page, at x 5…26: `S_01…S_10`, `P_`, `E_`, `C_`, `I_`, `A_`,
    `L_` (their UVs pick one of the 70 labels in `vitomatic_special-values1/2.dds`) and
    `Att_01…10` (blank, `NV_Vigor-Tester_Backdrop.dds`). Row 1 is at the bottom
    (z 69.3), row 10 at the top (z 114.7).
  - Poster segments at x −26…3: `SPECIAL-Title_<Page>`, `PB-<Page>_01…06`,
    `Desc-<Page>_01…04` for the pages Attract, Strength … Luck, Review (UVs into
    `vitomatic_page_0…4.dds`: page 0 holds "Rate Your…" and "Let's Review…", pages 1–4
    two attributes each).
  - Carriers that turn with the boards: `Value-Flippers_01…10`, `PB-Flippers_01…06`,
    `Desc-Flipper_01…04`, `SPECIAL-Title_Flipper` (the cabinet texture).
  - The review page's rows: `Index_<Stat>Decrease_Btn` (left, `BBDecreaseOff`),
    `Index_<Stat>PointVal` (the value, `BBNumber0`), `Index_<Stat>Increase_Btn` (right,
    `BBIncreaseOff`), Strength at the top (z 108.7) to Luck (z 86.4).
  - `P1_PointsRemainDigit1` (tens) and `Digit2` (ones), `BBNumber0` [observed: Digit2
    lies right of Digit1 on both pages].
  - The lever's two halves `P1_Increase_Btn` (upper, "+") and `P1_Decrease_Btn`
    (lower, "−"); the arrow buttons `P1_LT_Btn` (←), `P1_RT_Btn` (→), `LookInside_Btn`
    (→ of the first page) and `AllDone_Btn` (`BBLTOff`/`BBRTOff`).
  - The stored pose is the first page (Attract): the Attract layer and blank boards in
    front (y −10.87), the other pages' layers behind it at y −16.62 (Strength),
    −17.12, … −19.62 (Luck), −20.12 (Review), the blank boards when not in front at
    −16.12; the cabinet's backdrop quad (`Cabinet:9`, y −14.1) hides what is behind.

## 4. The sixteen sequences [observed: the end poses and keys of each]

Each `NiControllerSequence` keys all 229 nodes, clamps (cycle type 2), lasts 1.267–1.3 s
and carries only the text keys `start` and `end`. Their names are generic (locomotion
names); what each does:

| Sequence | Turns from → to | | Sequence | Turns from → to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Forward | Attract → Strength | | AimUp | Strength → Attract |
| Backward | Strength → Perception | | Aim | Perception → Strength |
| Left | Perception → Endurance | | Holster | Endurance → Perception |
| Right | Endurance → Charisma | | JumpLand | Charisma → Endurance |
| FastForward | Charisma → Intelligence | | JumpLoop | Intelligence → Charisma |
| FastBackward | Intelligence → Agility | | JumpStart | Agility → Intelligence |
| FastLeft | Agility → Luck | | TurnRight | Luck → Agility |
| FastRight | Luck → Review | | TurnLeft | Review → Luck |

In each, the outgoing page's boards and poster segments each turn once round
(Euler y −π → π, one after another from the top, about 0.33 s apiece) and drop back to
their layer, the incoming page's turn and come to the front. Besides:

- Forward: the lever's halves turn half round about z to face the player; `P1_RT_Btn`
  rises to z 58.72 and `LookInside_Btn` sinks to z 0 (out of sight below the base);
  `P1_LT_Btn` rises from 56.83 to 58.72; the points digits turn to face the player
  (Rx 11.0 → 14.14). AimUp undoes all of this.
- FastRight: the review rows turn to face the player (Rx −π → 0) and the points digits
  move to the review poster's circle (z 102.88 → 71.98, x −16.5/−19.9 → −2.4/−4.4,
  scale 1 → 0.52). TurnLeft undoes it.
- `AllDone_Btn` stays at z 0 in every sequence: no sequence shows it.

So the pages run Attract, Strength … Luck, Review, and the menu opens on Attract
[hypothesis: the stored pose and the chain start there; the owner's screenshots begin at
the attribute pages].

## 5. What the screenshots show [observed: the six screenshots]

- The machine fills the screen; the room shows blurred at both sides.
- Attribute page: title, "ADJUST YOUR SCORE… IT AIN'T CHEATIN'!", picture, the circle
  "05 POINTS TO GO" (the points remaining, not the attribute: all three pages read 05
  with every attribute at 5; it is the digits node, §3), description, "THIS AFFECTS
  YOUR…"; the attribute's ten labels on the boards; the bulbs 1…value lit white with a
  glow, the others dull gold with their numbers; ← and → both black with light arrows.
- Review page: the seven values in circles; ◄ and ► at each; at 00 points remaining
  every ► is gone (6.jpg); the circle at the bottom reads the points remaining; no bulb
  lit; blank boards. The → is grey at 05 and 02 remaining and black at 00.
- The mouse pointer over a row or the → changes nothing seen.
- The camera: fitted to ten points of 7.jpg and 10.jpg (label rows 1 and 10, their
  edges, the poster's edges, the lever's + and −, the two arrow buttons), 7 px RMS: an
  eye at model point (0, 78.4, 98.9) looking along −y, tipped 9.15° down, vertical
  field of view 48.4° [observed: fitted].

## 6. NVForever's menu [design unless tagged]

- Drawn as the two models (`…_cabinet.nif` and `…_activate.nif`) below the player's
  camera, scaled by 0.13 about the eye so that the machine is nearer than the walls,
  with the camera's field of view set to the fitted 48.4° while the menu is open and
  given back after. All parts unlit, each part's colour scaled towards the screenshots'
  lit look (boards and posters × 0.85, cabinet and lever × 0.45, unlit bulbs a dull
  gold). A black sheet at 45 % behind the machine darkens the room; no blur.
- A page turn plays the sequence of §4 on the model (from its start; a turn asked during
  another starts at once).
- The bulbs 1…value are lit on an attribute's page by showing their two glow shapes;
  none elsewhere.
- Numbers: each review row's value and the two digits of the points remaining show the
  `BBNumber<n>.dds` picture.
- Review rows: ◄ hidden at 1, ► hidden at 10 or with no point left (the ◄ at 1 by
  symmetry with 6.jpg [hypothesis]).
- → : `textures\terminals\pc\BBRTOff.dds` when it works, `pc\BBRTOn.dds` when not (on
  the review page until every point is given out); ← `pc\BBLTOff.dds` [hypothesis: the
  PC pictures, which show arrows as the screenshots do; the models name the console
  pictures with "RT"/"LT" on them].
- Keys: Left/Right or A/D lower/raise the attribute of the page (on the review page,
  the chosen row's); Up/Down or W/S choose the review row; Tab or Page Down the next
  page; Shift+Tab or Page Up the previous one; Enter or E Done. On the review page the
  → (and Tab) is Done too. Once Up/Down was used, the chosen row's arrows show their
  grey `On` pictures (the original shows no row with the mouse).
- Clicks: on the parts in front for the page (§3): ←, →, the first page's →, the lever's
  halves, and on the review page each row's ◄, ► and value (which chooses the row). A
  click is matched against each part's outline on the screen (its bounds projected),
  the smallest outline under the pointer winning.
- Done (only with 0 points left) writes the sheet to the player's permanent attributes
  and answers the menu (`fnv_game::chargen::SpecialSheet::apply`, `chargen::finish`).
- Log lines: `vigor tester: open, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. 5 5 5 5 5 5 5, 5 points remaining …`,
  `vigor tester: Strength 6, 4 points remaining (…)`, `vigor tester: page Strength
  (sequence Forward, …)`, `vigor tester: … refused: …`, `vigor tester: done,
  S.P.E.C.I.A.L. …`, `vigor tester: closed`, and at exit `vigor tester summary: …`.
- Test aid `NVF_PLAY_TEST_VIGOR` (module docs of `vigor.rs`); its seconds count from the
  menu's first frame, so a slow start does not run every step at once.

## 7. Check

Expect exit 0, "vigor tester: open, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. 5 5 5 5 5 5 5, 5 points remaining",
"page Strength (sequence Forward, click)", "Strength 7, 3 points remaining", "Done
refused: points still to give out", the turns to Review ending "(sequence FastRight …)",
"Endurance 6, 0 points remaining", "done, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. 7 5 6 5 5 5 7 (click)" and
"vigor tester summary: opened 1 times, 5 changes, 8 page turns, 2 clicks on its
buttons, done 1 times". `NVF_PLAY_TEST_SHOTS` saves pictures of the pages to compare
with the owner's.

## 8. Open questions

- The PC keys of the original menu (none in its file).
- Does the menu open on the "Rate Your… TRY IT NOW!" page, as the model's stored pose
  suggests, and does the ← work there (its button sits lower)?
- Is the → on the review page Done, or does `AllDone_Btn` (which no sequence raises)
  replace it once every point is given out?
- What do the `On` pictures of the buttons mean: dimmed (as the → in 10.jpg), pressed,
  or the chosen row?
- Does the ◄ of a row at 1 disappear as the ► does at 10 and at 0 points left?
- Is a row chosen with the keys shown, and how?
- Sounds (list 5 item 39): the menu file names none and the two models carry no sound
  key [observed]. NVForever plays Fallout 3's S.P.E.C.I.A.L. book sounds, which the
  masters keep with two records added for New Vegas [observed: FalloutNV.esm SOUN,
  files in `Fallout - Sound.bsa` under `sound\fx\obj\book\special\`; hypothesis:
  that the Vigor Tester plays them, by their names]: a page turn `OBJBookSpecialPageTurn`
  (two takes), an attribute raised `OBJBookSpecialNumber`, lowered
  `OBJBookSpecialNumberDown`, a review row chosen `OBJBookSpecialFocus`, Done
  `OBJBookSpecialNumberFinished`, a refusal `UIMenuCancel` (`nvf_play::ui_sounds`, menu
  `vigor tester`).
- Not built: the menu's fade (0.25 s in its file), any sounds of the lever and the bulbs
  of their own, and the repeat of a held Left/Right (`repeathorizontal`); a turn asked
  during another does not wait for it.
- The original lights the machine (shaded cabinet, golden unlit bulbs, a strong glow on
  lit ones) and blurs the room; NVForever's unlit approximation and dark sheet are
  stand-ins.
