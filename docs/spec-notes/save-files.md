# Save files (`.fos`): layout as observed

Clean-room notes on the original game's save file, written to plan NVForever's own save
and load system ([design/save-load.md](../design/save-load.md)). NVForever does not read or
write `.fos` files; this note says what the original keeps, so our save keeps the same
state. Tags: [documented] (public page named), [observed] (bytes in the saves below),
[hypothesis] (a reading that fits the bytes but is not proven). Offsets are byte offsets
in the file, little-endian unless stated.

No save bytes, dumps or screenshots are committed. The working copies and the parser used
for this note are in `C:\fnv-private\save-research\` (private).

## 1. The saves looked at

`C:\fnv-private\capture\saves-backup\` holds 27 folders, named by the Unix time at which
`tools/capture/capture_run.py` backed up the game's rolling saves (`autosave.fos`,
`autosave.fos.bak`, `autosave.nvse`) before a capture run (tools/capture/README.md). The
27 folders hold only **four different `.fos` files** [observed, MD5 of every file]:

| Name here | File (first folder holding it) | Size | Written by | Header place / play time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | `1791540675\autosave.fos.bak` | 1,860,200 | the owner's game, 2026-10-09 05:43 (owner-review.md, "Read first") | Goodsprings, 0:11:58, save number 15 |
| B | `1791540675\autosave.fos` | 1,776,091 | VCG01 stage 55's scripted `Autosave`, capture round 4 from save `nvfnew` (layer5-captures.md §10) | Doc Mitchell's House, 0:01:50, save number 16 |
| C | `1791556130\autosave.fos` | 1,854,167 | capture `pc_drop_fall`, loaded `nvfdoc`, walked out of Doc Mitchell's door (owner-review.md; `run_pc_drop_fall.json`) | Goodsprings, 0:11:50, save number 16 |
| D | `1791556382\autosave.fos` | 1,854,167 | capture `pc_push`, loaded `nvfdoc`, same door (`run_pc_push.json`) | Goodsprings, 0:11:51, save number 16 |

A fifth save, the owner's **"max save"** (`saves-backup\Max Save\`, called M here), is a
late full playthrough: save number 292, level 50, 61:01:36 play time, 8,050,402 bytes,
file dated 2013 [observed, header and file time]. It is used for the range of record types and sizes (§6.3).

C and D start from the same save and leave by the same door a few real minutes apart, so
their difference shows what moves with a little game time (§7). A and C share the same
form ID array and changed-form list (§6), so A is from the same line of play [observed].
B is a new game, before the player ever entered an exterior worldspace (§5.3).

The xNVSE co-save (`autosave.nvse`) is ignored: NVForever has no use for it.

## 2. Top-level layout

The file is a sequence of sections; a table after the plugin list gives the absolute
offsets of the later ones [observed, all four saves; offsets for C]:

| Section | C offset | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Magic `FO3SAVEGAME` (11 bytes, no terminator) | 0 | [observed]; the `.fos` extension is shared with Fallout 3 [documented: fileinfo.com ".FOS File Extension", no layout given] |
| Header size (u32) | 0x0B | counts the bytes from 0x0F to the start of the screenshot |
| Header (§3) | 0x0F | fields each followed by 0x7C |
| Screenshot (§3.2) | 0x0F + header size | width × height × 3 bytes |
| Form version byte, plugin block (§4) | after the screenshot | |
| File location table (§5) | after the plugins | 8 × u32 then 78 zero bytes |
| Global data table 1 (§5.1) | table[2] | 12 typed entries |
| Changed forms (§6) | table[3] | `changeFormCount` records |
| Global data table 2 (§5.2) | table[4] | 1 entry |
| Form ID array (§5.3) | table[0] | u32 count, then u32 form IDs |
| Worldspace array (§5.3) | right after the form ID array | u32 count, then u32 form IDs |
| Tail (9 bytes) | table[1] | `05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7C` in all four saves; meaning unknown |

The file ends exactly after the tail [observed: table[1] + 9 = file size in all five].

**The `|` byte.** Nearly every field in the header, the globals and the changed-form data
is followed by `0x7C` (`|`) [observed]. It carries no data: a reader skips it after each
field. The Oblivion (`TES4SAVEGAME`) and Skyrim layouts on UESP have no such separators
[documented: UESP "Tes4Mod:Save File Format", "Skyrim Mod:Save File Format"]; the rest of
the structure is close to Skyrim's (§5), which is the closest public description.

## 3. Header

### 3.1 Fields [observed, all four saves]

From 0x0F, each field followed by a 0x7C byte:

| Field | Encoding | Values seen |
|---|---|---|
| unknown | u32 | 0x30 in all four [hypothesis: header/format version] |
| language | 64 bytes, NUL-padded ASCII | `ENGLISH` |
| screenshot width | u32 | 512 |
| screenshot height | u32 | 288 |
| save number | u32 | 15 (A), 16 (B, C, D) |
| player name | u16 length, 0x7C, bytes | empty in B (a new game; the name is set in VCG01) [observed] |
| karma title | u16 length, 0x7C, bytes | "Drifter" |
| level | u32 | 1 |
| location name | u16 length, 0x7C, bytes | the cell's or worldspace region's display name |
| play time | u16 length, 0x7C, ASCII `HHH.MM.SS` | `000.11.50` |

Strings are length-prefixed (u16), a `|`, then the bytes without a terminator. The header
size therefore varies with the strings (137 bytes in A/C/D, 141 in B) [observed]. The
header holds no game date and no plugin list; the load menu's line is built from it alone
[hypothesis].

### 3.2 Screenshot

Width × height × 3 bytes, uncompressed, no padding [observed: 512 × 288 × 3 = 442,368
bytes ends exactly where the form-version byte starts]. Channel order RGB [hypothesis].

## 4. Form version and plugins [observed]

- u8 form version: 0x1B (27). Every changed form carries the same version byte (§6).
- u32 size of the plugin block (199 in all four), then:
- u8 plugin count (10), `|`, then per plugin: u16 length, `|`, name, `|`.

M lists nine (no `GunRunnersArsenal.esm`) in a different order (`FalloutNV.esm`,
`HonestHearts.esm`, `TribalPack.esm`, …) [observed], so the list is the load order the
save was made with, not a fixed list. The ten names in A–D are the base game masters in load order (`FalloutNV.esm`, the four story
DLCs, `GunRunnersArsenal.esm`, the four packs). A plugin's position is its mod index in
the form IDs that follow [hypothesis, consistent with every form ID resolving to a record
of the expected type in that master, §6].

## 5. File location table and global data

Right after the plugin block: eight u32 values, then 78 zero bytes up to the first global
entry [observed]. Matched against Skyrim's table [documented, UESP "Skyrim Mod:Save File
Format": six offsets, four counts, `unused[15]`], the New Vegas table is shorter:

| # | Meaning | C value | How it was matched |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | form ID array offset | 1,818,058 | points at a u32 count followed by that many form IDs [observed] |
| 1 | tail offset | 1,854,158 | equals the end of the worldspace array [observed] |
| 2 | global data table 1 offset | 442,834 | first typed entry starts there [observed] |
| 3 | changed forms offset | 445,396 | = end of table 1; the record walk starts there [observed] |
| 4 | global data table 2 offset | 1,818,050 | = end of the record walk [observed] |
| 5 | table 1 count | 12 | 12 entries tile table 1 exactly [observed] |
| 6 | table 2 count | 1 | |
| 7 | changed form count | 4,220 (A, C, D), 3,885 (B) | walking this many records lands exactly on offset 4 [observed] |

A global entry is u32 type, u32 length, then `length` bytes [observed, same as Skyrim's
documented layout].

### 5.1 Global data table 1 (types 0–11) [observed unless tagged]

| Type | Length (C) | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 220 | (every value below is followed by 0x7C) u32 count 43, 43 × (u32). All zero in B (new game); first two are 1 in A/C/D. The misc statistics by code: the values of 31 saves fit the names (misc-stats.md §1) [observed] |
| 1 | 57 | **Player location and created-form counter**: u32 next created form ID (0xFF001313 in C, 0xFF001309 in B, 0xFF001317 in A); ref of the current worldspace (WastelandNV in C, a dummy worldspace FFEncounterWorld in B, which is indoors); two i32 cell grid coordinates (−18, 0 in C); ref of the worldspace or interior cell the player is in (GSDocMitchellHouse in B); three f32 position (no separator between them); ref of a quest (VCG01 in B, VCG02 in C) [hypothesis: the active quest shown in the Pip-Boy]; u32, f32, u32 unknown |
| 2 | 107 | a short list of mostly zero values; unchanged between all four saves; meaning unknown |
| 3 | 1803 | **Global variables**: vsval count (200), then per global: ref and f32, each followed by 0x7C. 199 resolve to GLOB records, one to form 0x63 (no record in the masters [hypothesis: a hard-coded global]). Game time is here: GameHour, GameDaysPassed, GameDay/Month/Year, TimeScale (30) |
| 4 | 30 | three f32 and six bytes; the third float moved between C and D (10.388 → 10.402); meaning unknown |
| 5 | 36 | u32 1, flags, floats; two floats moved between C and D; meaning unknown |
| 6 | 33 | u32 1003, small values; identical in all four |
| 7 | 2 | one byte (0) |
| 8 | 71 | **Sky and weather**: ref current weather, ref second weather (NVWastelandGS and NVWastelandClear in C; WastelandClear twice in B), then f32 values; two of them equal GameHour exactly (9.4697 in C) [observed: matches the GameHour global]; the rest unknown |
| 9 | 7 | u32 0 and a byte |
| 10 | 96 (C), 80 (B) | a vsval-counted list of refs (18 in C, 14 in B); meaning unknown |
| 11 | 4 | one ref (resolves to a SOUN record in C) [hypothesis: unknown; the resolution may be meaningless] |

### 5.2 Global data table 2

One entry, type 1000, length 0, in all four saves [observed].

### 5.3 Form ID array and worldspace array

- Form ID array: u32 count, then count × u32 form IDs (9,022 in A/C/D, 7,237 in B). Most
  are references (ACHR, REFR, ACRE) and their bases (NPC_, CREA), packages, quests,
  scripts, navmeshes, globals, cells [observed: resolving each against the masters].
  No entry has mod index 0xFF in any of the four.
- Worldspace array: u32 count, then form IDs. C has one (WastelandNV, 0x000DA726); B has
  none: the new-game player had not been outdoors [observed]. [hypothesis: the worldspaces
  the player has visited; Oblivion's page calls its equivalent of unknown purpose,
  documented, UESP Tes4Mod].

### 5.4 Refs and vsval

- **Ref** (3 bytes, big-endian): the top 2 bits are a kind, the low 22 bits a value.
  Kind 0: value is a 1-based index into the form ID array (0 = none); kind 1: a form ID in
  `FalloutNV.esm` directly; kind 2: a created form (0xFF000000 | value) [documented for
  Skyrim, UESP "Skyrim Mod:Save File Format"; observed for New Vegas: index − 1 makes every
  changed form resolve to a record of the type its record type says, §6, while the plain
  index does not]. Kind 1 was seen (e.g. world ref `00 01 95`), kind 2 was not.
- **vsval** (variable-size count): the low 2 bits of the first byte give the width (0 = 1
  byte, 1 = 2 bytes, 2 = 4 bytes), the value is the little-endian number shifted right by
  2 [hypothesis: fits every count seen: `21 03` = 200 globals, `98` = 38 quest stages,
  `04` = 1 item, `1C` = 7 variables].

## 6. Changed forms

Each record [observed: the walk tiles the section exactly in all four saves]:

| Field | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ref | 3 | §5.4 |
| change flags | u32 | which kinds of change follow |
| type | u8 | low 6 bits: record type; high 2 bits: width of the length field (0 = u8, 1 = u16, 2 = u32) |
| version | u8 | 27 in every record (= the form version byte, §4) |
| length | 1/2/4 | data size |
| data | length | the changes, in a fixed order; fields are each followed by 0x7C |

Skyrim's documented header has a second length (uncompressed size); New Vegas has only
one and no compression [observed].

The data has no per-field tags: which fields are present follows from the change flags and
the record type, as in Oblivion [documented, UESP Tes4Mod: "Bit order does not match the
order of subrecords", flags say which subrecords are present]. This note decodes the parts
needed to plan our own save; the rest is listed as unknown.

### 6.1 Types seen [observed, C; B has the same types]

Type numbers are matched by resolving each record's ref against the masters:

| Type | Record | Count C (B) | Change flag bits seen |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | REFR (placed objects) | 317 | 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 27, 28, 29, 31 |
| 1 | ACHR (placed NPCs, and the player ref 0x14) | 2,418 | 0, 1, 4, 5, 11, 18, 20, 21, 27, 28, 29, 31 |
| 2 | ACRE (placed creatures) | 900 | 0, 1, 5, 10, 11, 18, 20, 27, 28, 29, 31 |
| 7 | CELL | 15 | 1, 29, 30, 31 |
| 8 | INFO (dialogue responses) | 52 (13) | 31, always with no data |
| 9 | QUST | 466 | 1, 2, 29, 30, 31 |
| 10 | NPC_ (only the player base, 0x7) | 1 | 2, 5 |
| 11 | CREA | 1 | 1 |
| 33 | CLAS (PlayerClass) | 1 | 1 |
| 34 | FACT | 4 | 2 |
| 37 | FLST (form lists) | 41 | 31 |
| 40 | LVLI (leveled items) | 1 | 31 |
| 50 | CHAL (challenges) | 3 | 1 |

Not seen in A–D: created forms (kind-2 refs); M has them (§6.3).

Not every actor is listed: the masters hold 3,942 ACHR and 3,739 ACRE, the saves 2,418 /
900 (C) and 2,406 / 893 (B) [observed], so the original keeps a record for a large fixed
set of actors (most of them untouched by the player) [hypothesis: the persistent ones].

### 6.2 What is decoded per type

**QUST** [observed: VCG01 in B is at stage 55 per its capture; its record shows stages up
to 55 done and 60 not done]:

- flag bit 1: one byte of quest flags (0x31 in B where VCG01 is running, 0x32 in C)
  [hypothesis: the quest's running/completed flags].
- bit 2: an f32 first (9.0, 5.0, 0.05 seen) [hypothesis: the quest script's processing
  delay, SetQuestDelay].
- bit 31: **stages**: vsval count, then per stage: u8 stage index, `|`, u8 done, `|`, vsval
  log-entry count, then per entry: u8 entry index, `|`, u8 done, `|`, and when done 4
  bytes `23 01 E9 08` / `24 01 E9 08` [hypothesis: a date stamp, u16 day value then u16
  year 2281; the later stages in C carry the later value].
- bit 30 (465 of 466 quests): **script variables** (vsval count, then per variable: u32
  index, `|`, f64 value, `|`), then two more vsval-counted lists that were empty in every
  quest looked at. A quest with no changes but bit 30 stores `00|00|00`.
- bit 29: **objectives**: vsval count, then per objective: u32 objective index, `|`, u32
  state, `|`. States 1 and 3 seen [hypothesis: 1 = displayed, 3 = displayed and
  completed]. B: VCG01 objective 10 = 1; C: objectives 10, 30, 40, 50 = 3.

Variables are stored as f64 even though scripts declare short/int/float/ref [observed:
`00 00 00 00 00 00 F0 3F` = 1.0]; ref variables were not identified.

**REFR** [observed bytes; meanings hypothesis unless said]:

- bit 0: u32 that looks like the record header's flag word (0x409, 0x29, 0x800809 seen)
  [hypothesis: form flags, including the disabled state].
- bit 2: worldspace/cell ref, then six f32 with no separators (position, rotation), `|`.
  Seen on refs moved by physics (tumbleweeds, items) [hypothesis: "moved"].
- bit 4: one f32 (1.0 seen) [hypothesis: scale or health].
- bit 5 and bit 27: **item lists**: vsval count, then per item: ref, `|`, u32 count, `|`,
  then a vsval-counted list of extra-data lists (type byte 0x2F, 0x24, 0x25 seen with
  small payloads) [hypothesis: the container's inventory changes; extra types carry
  condition, ownership, count]. Vendor containers and Doc Mitchell's dresser have them.
- bit 12: door data (`2A`, a byte, a ref, two u32) on doors [hypothesis: lock or teleport].
- bit 28 and bit 31: animation/script data: vsval, a script ref, then u32 index + f64
  value pairs (as in quests) and short strings such as `Backward`, `Close`,
  `SpecialIdle` [hypothesis: bit 31 = script variables of the reference, bit 28 =
  animation state].
- bit 29: a short ref list ending `74 | ref` [unknown].

**ACHR / ACRE**: flag 0x40000 (bit 18) on 2,020 of 2,418 ACHR records, data 297 bytes for
most [observed]. These include an f32 near 17,634 that moved with game time between C and
D and a u32 that grew by 765 [observed]; meanings unknown. The player ref (0x14) record is
4,429 bytes in C (flags 0xB0000832) and starts with a ref and six f32 like REFR bit 2
[observed]. Not decoded further: the player's inventory, actor values, effects and
perks are somewhere in it [hypothesis].

**NPC_ 0x7 (player base)**: bit 2: seven bytes `05 05 05 05 05 05 0A` [hypothesis: the
seven SPECIAL values]; bit 5: the player's name (u16 length, `|`, string) [observed: the
same name as the header].

**CELL**: bit 1: one byte (cell flags) [hypothesis]; bits 30/31: blocks with the value
0x129 = 297 [observed: 297 = GameDaysPassed (12.39) × 24, so hours passed;
hypothesis: the cell's detach time, for respawn and reset] and runs of `0F 00` / `F0 00`
bytes [hypothesis: local map fog-of-war bits, interiors].

**INFO**: bit 31, no data. 13 in B (new game), 52 in C [hypothesis: "this response has
been said", the say-once flag and the "said" condition functions].

**FACT** (PlayerFaction and three others): bit 2: vsval count, then per entry: ref, `|`,
u32, `|`, u32, `|` [hypothesis: faction relations, ref + modifier + combat reaction].

**FLST** bit 31: vsval count, then refs [hypothesis: form lists changed by script,
AddFormToFormList]. **LVLI** bit 31: entries of ref, u16 level, u16 count, f32
[hypothesis: leveled list changed by script, AddItemToLeveledList]. **CHAL** bit 1:
u32 1, u32 0 [hypothesis: challenge progress]. **CLAS** bit 1 (PlayerClass): four u32,
three skill-like values and −1 [hypothesis: the player's tag skills].

### 6.3 The max save (M) [observed unless tagged]

M parses with the same rules: the record walk ends exactly at table offset 4 after
42,784 changed forms, the form ID array holds 60,872 IDs, and the file ends after the same
9-byte tail. Form IDs resolve against the masters **in M's own load order** (resolving them
with A–D's order gives wrong record types), confirming that a form ID's mod index is the
plugin's position in the save's list.

- **Worldspace array**: 23 worldspaces, including the four story DLCs' (Zion, the Villa and
  its town worldspaces, Big MT, the Divide) and the Strip, Freeside, Boulder City.
  Together with B (none, never outdoors) this supports "worldspaces visited" [hypothesis].
- **Created forms** (kind-2 refs, 0xFF…): 574 records: 556 REFR (type 0, 32–593 bytes),
  15 ACRE (type 2, about 0.5–1.8 KB) and 3 of type 3 (546 bytes each, holding short
  strings and a SOUN-like ref) [hypothesis: type 3 = placed projectile/missile]. A created
  REFR's data starts like REFR bit 2 (cell ref, six f32) followed by a u16 and a 2-byte
  value, then the usual `|`-separated fields [observed]; its base form is somewhere in that
  data [hypothesis]. The next created form ID is 0xFF00155E.
- **Global table 1 grows with play**: type 2 is 4,329 bytes: vsval count 603, then
  (ref, `|`, u16, `|`) entries [hypothesis: a count per base form, such as the per-actor
  death counts Oblivion keeps, documented UESP Tes4Mod]; type 9 is 221,569 bytes (7 in
  A–D; contents not decoded); type 10 is 2,793 bytes and holds a radio song's file path
  (`data\sound\songs\radionv\…mp3`) [hypothesis: radio and music playback state]; type 0
  (43 u32) holds large counts (up to 147,591) [hypothesis: misc statistics].
- **Record types beyond A–D**: 4 PGRE (placed grenades, 205), 13 TACT (talking
  activators, 21), 31 NOTE (16, no data) [hypothesis: notes the player has], 32 ECZN
  (encounter zones, 20, 17 bytes each: four u32 such as 0x622, 0x620, 0x620, 0x18)
  [hypothesis: game-day stamps and the zone's level, for respawn], 35 PACK (1),
  43 REPU (reputations, 9: bit 1, two f32, e.g. 2.0 and 0.0) [hypothesis: fame and
  infamy], and many more NPC_ (573, bits 2, 3, 9: seven SPECIAL-like bytes, then a block of
  14 skill-like bytes) [hypothesis: base stats of levelled NPCs fixed at first meeting].
- **Counts and sizes** (data bytes, min / median / max): REFR 26,683 (0 / 19 / 4,856);
  ACHR 3,560 (285 / 528 / 2,675); ACRE 2,861 (281 / 954 / 3,693); CELL 4,208
  (2 / 42 / 858); INFO 3,332 (all 0); QUST 483 (2 / 20 / 695); CHAL 130; FACT 46
  (5 / 44 / 870); FLST 36 (9 / 25 / 405). The player ref record is **108,445 bytes**
  (4,429 in C) [observed]; its contents were not decoded.

Size guide for our own format: a 61-hour game keeps state for about 42,800 forms; most of
it is per-reference (REFR, ACHR, ACRE: 33,000) and per-cell (4,200) [observed].

## 7. What moves between C and D [observed]

C and D: same starting save, same door, about a second of game time apart (GameHour
9.46967 → 9.47007). File size, form ID array, worldspace array and the set of changed
forms are identical. What differs:

- header: play time 0:11:50 → 0:11:51;
- globals: GameHour and GameDaysPassed (table 1 type 3), the two GameHour copies in the
  weather entry (type 8), and floats in types 4 and 5;
- every ACHR and ACRE record (3,318) changes data without changing size: in the common 297-byte ACHR
  layout, an f32 at data offset 54 (17,634.11 → 17,634.16) and a u16/u32 at 240
  (11,688 → 12,453) [observed]; other layouts change the same kind of fields at other
  offsets; the player record changes;
- 38 REFR records, all with flag bit 28 (with or without 31 and 27): the animation/script
  data of activators [hypothesis: animation timers];
- one QUST record (vDialogueGomorrah): script variable 24 holds a copy of GameDaysPassed
  (12.39…) and moved with it;
- no stage, objective, INFO, CELL or FLST record changes.

So almost every actor record carries values that move with time even when nothing
happens to the actor [observed]. A versus C (the same line of play, different session)
differs in 82 REFR records (scripted animation/state data, the moved items), 7 QUST
records (script variables), the player and every actor.

## 8. Open questions

- The meaning of global types 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and of the 9-byte tail.
- The ACHR/ACRE layouts (flags 1, 11, 18, 29, 31) and the player record: inventory,
  actor values, effects, perks, AI state.
- The full layout of created references (M has 574; their base form and extra data were
  not decoded), and of global types 9 and 10, which grow with play.
- The QUST date stamp's day encoding.

None of these is needed for NVForever's own format; they would matter only to import a
`.fos`, which is not planned (design/save-load.md §6).
