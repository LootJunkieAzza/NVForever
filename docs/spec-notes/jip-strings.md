# Spec note: JIP string, name and regex functions

The JIP LN NVSE functions in the wiki's string categories: regular expressions, the
load-order-proof reference keys, form names and text fields, and string game settings.
Task J2 of [jip-tasks.md](../handoff/jip-tasks.md); input for J5. Math, mod and file
functions are in [jip-math-utility.md](jip-math-utility.md).

Wiki statements are `[documented: <page>]` (private export `C:\fnv-private\geckwiki\`, in
our own words). Results from the original game (JIP 57.30, xNVSE 6.4.9) are
`[observed: jip-forms/<id>]`: runtime-compiled probes, `tools/capture/jip_probes.py
--set jip-forms`, 2026-10-26, 24 rows, golden private. The forms used are vanilla
FalloutNV.esm records fetched with GetFormFromMod. Game text longer than a word is
recorded by its length only.

## 1. Regular expressions

| Function | Origin | Arguments | Returns | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| sv_RegexMatch | JIP | target (string_var); pattern (formatted string, up to 20 values) | 0/1 | whether the target matches the pattern [documented: Sv RegexMatch] |
| sv_RegexSearch | JIP | target; pattern (formatted) | array_var | every match in the target, in order [documented: Sv RegexSearch] |
| sv_RegexReplace | JIP | target; `"replacement\|pattern"` as **one** formatted string | string_var | a copy with every match replaced [documented: Sv RegexReplace] |
| ValidateRegex | NVSE 6.2.9 | pattern (string); error text (string_var, optional) | int | 0 when valid, else an error code: -1 arguments, 1 collate, 2 ctype, 3 escape, 4 backref, 5 brackets, 6 parentheses, 7 braces, 8 bad brace, 9 range, 10 space, 11 bad repeat, 12 complexity, 13 stack, 14 unknown [documented: ValidateRegex] |

Observed:
- `sv_RegexMatch` matches the **whole** target. "Whatchamacallit" against "(What)(.*)"
  gives 1, against "What" gives 0, and against "x(.*)" gives 0 [observed: regex.match,
  regex.partial, regex.nomatch].
- The wiki's search example finds 3 matches, the first "subject"; its replace example
  gives "This blip! has a blip! as a blip!" [observed: regex.search, regex.search0,
  regex.replace]. A `\b` inside a script string reaches the regex as written: the script
  compiler does not treat it as an escape.
- `ValidateRegex "["` gives 5 [observed: regex.validate], as documented.
- The target must be a string_var. A literal string there does not compile; use
  `(sv_Construct "…")` or a string_var variable [observed: jip_rx_trial, see
  xnvse-capture.md §5].

The pages warn that an invalid pattern **crashes the game** [documented: all three].
NVForever does not copy a crash: an invalid pattern is an extender run-time error (the
statement fails, the script goes on), the same decision as for Sv_Replace with an empty
old text.

**Dialect.** The wiki does not name it. ValidateRegex's error names are the error kinds
of the C++ standard library's regex [hypothesis: the dialect is that library's default,
ECMAScript]. Behaviour to keep: whole-string match for RegexMatch, `\b`, groups,
`[^ ]`, `.*`. A Rust implementation needs back-references (ECMAScript has them), which
the `regex` crate lacks. Candidate: `fancy-regex` (dependencies.md), anchored with
`^(?:…)$` for RegexMatch. Owner review is not needed: the observed cases decide it.

## 2. Reference keys

| Function | Origin | Behaviour | Observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| RefToString | JIP | a load-order-independent key for a form: `<plugin file>:<form ID without the mod index, hex, no leading zeros>`. Called on a reference it describes the reference; given a reference as an argument it describes the **base form** [documented: RefToString] | Doc Mitchell's base form = "FalloutNV.esm:104C0C" (as the wiki's example); the player reference = "FalloutNV.esm:14" [observed: reftostring.base, reftostring.player] |
| StringToRef | JIP | the form back from RefToString's text, or from GetFormIDString's eight hex digits [documented: StringToRef] | "FalloutNV.esm:104C0C" → 00104C0C [observed: stringtoref.modkey]; "00000014" → the player [observed: jip-getters/stringtoref.player] |

The upper-case hex and the dropped leading zeros come from the observed keys.

## 3. Names and text fields

| Function | Origin | Arguments | Returns | Behaviour | Observed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LNGetName | LU | form (optional; else the calling reference) | string | the full name of a reference or base form, any named type; unlike GetName it sees names set with SetRefName [documented: LNGetName] | Doc Mitchell = "Doc Mitchell"; the Prospector Saloon cell = "Prospector Saloon" [observed: lngetname.*] |
| GetFormDescription | JIP | base form | string_var | the Description text of a note, perk, message, terminal, weapon mod, challenge, loading screen … [documented: GetFormDescription] | perk Action Boy: 84 characters; an NPC (no description): "" [observed: formdesc.*] |
| GetObjectiveText | JIP | quest, objective index | string_var | the objective's display text [documented: GetObjectiveText] | VCG02 objective 30: 28 characters; objective 9999: "" [observed: objective.*] |
| GetBodyPartName | JIP | body-part data, part 0–14 | string_var | the name of a part. Parts: 0 torso, 1–2 head, 3–4 left arm, 5–6 right arm, 7–9 left leg, 10–12 right leg, 13 brain, 14 weapon [documented: GetBodyPartName] | NVGecko part 0 = "Torso"; part 14 = "" [observed: bodypart.*] |
| GetNthPerkEntryString | LU | perk, index | string | the string of a perk entry (the activate prompt of type 4) [documented: GetNthPerkEntryString] | Action Boy entry 0 = "" (not that type) [observed: perkentry.0] |
| GetLoadScreenTexture | LU | loading screen | string | its texture path [documented] | GeneralLoadScreen01 = `interface\loading\loading_billboard05.dds`, as documented [observed: loadscreen.texture] |
| GetProjectileMuzzleFlash | JIP | projectile | string | the muzzle-flash model path [documented] | 9mmBulletProjectile = `effects\MuzzleFlashes\handgunmuzzleflash01.nif` (case kept) [observed: muzzleflash] |
| GetFontFile | JIP | font type 1–8, 10–89 | string_var | the font's .fnt path [documented: GetFontFile] | 2 = `Textures\Fonts\Monofonto_Large.fnt`; 9 (outside the range) = "" [observed: fontfile.*] |
| GetStringSetting | LU | game setting name | string | a string game setting [documented: GetStringSetting] | sTraitMenuTitleText = its value, with `%d` left in [observed: stringsetting] |
| GetMapMarkerName | LU | — (map marker reference) | string | the marker's name [documented] | not probed |
| GetUIString | JIP | "Menu/element/…/trait" | string_var | a UI trait's string (J8, UI) [documented] | not probed |

A missing entry, part or objective gives an empty string, not an error [observed]. Text
comes from the loaded records (with later plugins overriding), so NVForever reads the
same fields fnv-esm already decodes: FULL, DESC, objective NNAM, BPTD part names, LSCR
ICON, PROJ muzzle-flash model.

**Setters** (not probed; they change the game). LNSetName sets the **base form's** name,
even when called on a reference [documented: LNSetName]. SetFullNameAlt (alias
SetActorFullNameAlt) also changes the base form, and the change is **permanent and kept
in the save**, unlike SetName and LNSetName [documented: SetFullNameAlt]. SetRefName
names one reference (read back by LNGetName). SetFormDescription, SetObjectiveText,
SetBodyPartName, SetMapMarkerName, SetStringSetting, SetLoadScreenTexture and
SetProjectileMuzzleFlash replace the field the matching getter reads. The texts of
SetFormDescription and SetObjectiveText are formatted strings (up to 20 values)
[documented: their pages]. Whether the others last past a reload is not documented
[hypothesis: no, like base-game form changes without a save record]. Probing this needs
a save and a reload, so it waits for the J5 implementation.

## 4. Not covered

GetStringHash has a page with no content (JIP 57.30) [documented: GetStringHash]. It is
left out until its behaviour can be observed. AuxiliaryVariable…String and
RefMapArray…String belong to JIP's variable stores and go in the arrays note.
