# MCM: the mod author's contract, checked against NVForever (issue #2298)

The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) is a mod: its own menu files (`menus\prefabs\MCM\*.xml`,
included into `StartMenu`) and its own scripts (`The Mod Configuration Menu.esp`) draw
the window and run it. A mod that wants a page talks to MCM only through traits of the
`StartMenu/MCM` tile tree, with the extender's UI functions, as MCM's author describes in
his guide for mod authors. NVForever does not reimplement MCM: it runs MCM's files and
scripts (menu-xml.md §10) and has to give them, and the mods' scripts, what the original
engine and extender give. This note lists what the guide asks of a menu, item by item, and
says where NVForever stands on each.

Sources: [documented: MCM Guide v6 (Pelinor, 2012-05-10), the owner's copy, kept
private, cited by section]; MCM 1.5's own files and scripts as installed in the owner's
Blue Moon list [observed: the files; the scripts' source text in the plugin]; runs of
NVForever on that list (§5). No extender or MCM DLL code was read. Nothing of the guide
is copied here; it is described.

## 1. How a mod's page works [documented: the guide, "The Basics"]

- The mod makes a quest that starts with the game, with a script whose `MenuMode 1013`
  block (the start menu, which the pause menu is) does the work, and a misc item whose
  name is the mod's line in MCM's list. At `GetGameRestarted` it adds that item to MCM's
  form list, form `0xAE6` of MCM's plugin (by `BuildRef` of MCM's mod index and 2790),
  when `IsModLoaded "The Mod Configuration Menu.esp"`.
- Every frame of that block, it returns unless MCM is loaded, and acts only while
  `StartMenu/MCM/_ActiveMod` equals `GetModIndex` of its own plugin. It reads
  `_ActiveOption` (the option the player works) and `_Value` into locals, then answers at
  most one of MCM's requests, each a trait of `StartMenu/MCM` that MCM sets and the mod
  clears: `_Reset` (fill the page in again: clear it, set `_columns` and every option's
  traits), `_Default` (the Defaults button: set the mod's defaults, clear it, set `_Reset`),
  `_NewValue` (the player chose a value: take `_Value`, or `_Value1`-`_Value3` for types 8
  and 9, clear it, set `_Reset` so the page shows it), `_ShowList == 1` (fill the list
  window, set it to 2), `_ShowScale == 1` (fill the slider window, set it to 2) and
  `_DefaultScale` (the slider window's Default: put the default in `_Value`, clear it, set
  `_ShowScale` 2). The mouse-over text is a separate test on `MCM_Options`' `_optionID`.
- Paths are written with the extender's `GetUIFloat`, `SetUIFloat`, `SetUIString` and
  `SetUIStringEx` (formatted as PrintToConsole), either by name
  (`StartMenu/MCM/MCM_Options/Option2/_value`) or by place: `*:N` is the N-th child,
  counted from 1 (`StartMenu/MCM/*:4` is MCM's fourth child; `*:1/*:2` Option2 of the
  options panel; `*:2` the slider window, `*:3` the list window, `*:5` the mod list,
  `*:8` the title, `*:9` the info line). Names are exact but not case-sensitive.

## 2. Coverage

Status: **ok** (works as the guide says, by MCM's own files and scripts on NVForever's
tree and functions), **fixed** (wrong before #2298, right now), **partly**, **open**.
"MCM's" means the behaviour comes from MCM's files or scripts, which NVForever runs.

### 2.1 Paths and functions

| Guide item | NVForever | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GetUIFloat, SetUIFloat, SetUIString, SetUIStringEx on `StartMenu/MCM/…` | `fnv_game::ui_functions` | ok |
| `*:N` is the N-th child from 1 (Introduction, The Options Panel, Using Lists, The Mouse-over Panel, Sub-Menus) | the extender's four count from the first child (`fnv_ui::Count::FromFirst`: 1 the first, 0 the last); before, every UI function counted from the last child from 0, as JIP's `…Alt` functions were measured to (hud.md §14.8), so `*:1/*:4/_value` reached a tile near the end of MCM's tree and a mod's page stayed empty or kept old values | fixed |
| `*:1/*:N/value/*:1/string` is the option's value text (types 1, 2.5, 3, 7, 8) | the `value` rect's first child is `text` [observed: OptionRect.xml], reached since the fix above (before: its last, `toggle_check`) | fixed |
| Names without case; `_` prefixes kept | `fnv_ui::Ui::find_trait` | ok |
| SetUIStringEx's format codes (`%g`, `%.1f`, `%.2f`, `%q`) | the VM's formatter | ok |
| `%k`: a key's display for type 3 options | the key's name from GetKeyName's observed table (`fnv_script::keys`; code 18 gives "E") [hypothesis: `%k` gives GetKeyName's text] | fixed (c3429025e on #2276) |
| GetModINISetting / SetModINISetting `ini/section/key` under `Data\Config` (Variable Storage) | `fnv_game::mod_files`: read and written in NVForever's own mod-files store (never the game folder) | ok |
| The short names GetModINI / SetModINI | aliases in the function table (`schemas/script/functions.json`) | ok |
| MCM's own log of those calls (`mcm.log`) | not written | open (not needed by any script) |

### 2.2 Registering and the list (Getting Started, Multiple Menus, Sub-Menus)

| Guide item | NVForever | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A start-enabled quest's `MenuMode 1013` block runs while MCM is open | the pause menu's Mods page runs the start menu's MenuMode blocks every frame (`nvf_play::tiles::mods`, menu-xml.md §10.1) | ok |
| Low script processing delay | MenuMode blocks run every frame there | ok |
| `ListAddForm` of the mod's item to `BuildRef iMaster 2790` at `GetGameRestarted` | ok; the start menu's frames before the game run (`Game::came_through_start_menu`) | ok |
| The item's name is the mod's line; the order is not by the name | MCM's list script sorts by plugin then by the item's value, `SetMCMModList` writes the row (menu-xml.md §10.2) | ok |
| `_ActiveMod` is the chosen mod's `GetModIndex` | `SetMCMModList` writes the row's `_modIndex` from the item's source mod; MCM copies it on a click | ok |
| Clicking a mod's line chooses it | MCM ignores the pointer while its `_AltInput` is on; with Vanilla UI Plus and MCM Extender that trait is `globals()`'s `_Has360Controller`, which the file sets to 1 and the code keeps to whether a controller is connected (§3) | fixed |
| Several lines for one mod: each item's value higher than the last; `_ActiveMenu` says which | the row's `_modIndex2` is the item's value, MCM copies it into `_ActiveMenu` | ok |
| Up to 10 sub-menus: `*:5/SubMenu#/_enable`, `SubMenu#/text/string`, `*:8/SubTitle#/string`, `_ActiveSubMenu` (0 the main page) | by name (the guide warns against `*:N` there); placed by MCM's files and list script | ok |
| A mod whose sub-menus appear only while it is chosen | JIP Companions Command & Control compares `_ActiveMod` with a global JIP LN writes; unwritten, its three sub-menu lines stood over the mod names with no mod chosen (§4) | fixed |

### 2.3 The options panel (The Options Panel, option types)

| Guide item | NVForever | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `_columns` 1: one list over the panel's width; 2: odd options left, even right | MCM's OptionRect `_x1`/`_x2` and `y` by `_optionID / _columns`; `src="me"` read as the tile itself (#2270, menu-xml.md §10.3) | ok |
| Default columns | Options.xml `_columns` 1 | ok |
| `_enable` 0 hidden, 1 shown, 2 shown but greyed and not chosen | MCM's `visible`, `target` (only `_enable` 1) and `_alpha` | ok |
| `_title`, `_prefix` (before the value), `_suffix` 1 with `_suffixText` (after it) | MCM's `title`, `value/prefix`, `value/suffix` texts | ok |
| `_type` 0 title only (no value, not chosen: MCM's `_target` needs a type) | MCM's | ok |
| `_type` 1 list: value text set by the mod; chosen, MCM shows the list window | MCM's main script starts its list quest | ok |
| `_type` 2 whole number: MCM writes the value text from `_value` (`%g`) | MCM's main script, SetMCMString | ok |
| `_type` 2.5 decimal: value text set by the mod with SetUIStringEx | reached by `*:N` since the fix | fixed |
| `_type` 3 key: chosen, "press the new control"; the key's scan code becomes `_Value` | MCM's script reads `GetKeyPress 0`, `GetMouseButtonPress 0`, `IsKeyPressed 264/265` (`fnv_game::script_input`); the name shown by `%k` | ok |
| `_type` 4 OFF/ON, 5 check box, 6 `_textOff`/`_textOn`: a click flips the value (`_Value` = 1 − `_value`, `_NewValue` 1) | MCM's main script; the click reaches it since §3 | fixed |
| `_type` 5's box picture | MCM writes `value/toggle_check/filename` `MCM\Check0.dds` / `Check1.dds` | ok |
| `_type` 7 fixed text | value text by the mod | ok |
| `_type` 8 two or three numbers; `_type` 9 a colour box from `_value1`-`_value3` | MCM's scale script; the mod reads `_Value1`-`_Value3` | ok |
| `_altFont` 1-8, `_brightness`, `_highlight` 0/1, `_indent` (×4 × `_padding`), `_RGB` / `_RGBAlt` nine-digit colours (defaults 255,182,066 and 255,255,255) | MCM's OptionRect expressions (Vanilla UI Plus replaces the colours by the HUD colour and brightness) | ok |
| `_dUI` for DarNified UI | MCM's `_dUI` from `StartMenu/_isPauseMenu` | ok |
| Scrolling the options (more lines than fit) | MCM's arrows and `_offset`, its navigate script; the wheel through `IsKeyPressed 264/265` | partly (not run here) |

### 2.4 The list, slider and info windows

| Guide item | NVForever | Status |
|---|---|---|
| List: `*:3/_title`, `*:3/*:N/_enable`, `*:3/*:N/text/string`, `_Value` 1-10 the item shown chosen | by `*:N` since the fix; MCM's list script sizes and shows it | fixed |
| A list item clicked becomes `_Value`, `_NewValue` 1 | MCM's list script (`_active` of MCM_List) | ok (by the files) |
| Slider: `_Value`, `_ValueDecimal`, `_ValueIncrement`, `_ValueMax`, `_ValueMin`, `*:2/_suffixText`, `*:2/_title` | named traits of MCM's rect; MCM's scale script | ok |
| Slider buttons Accept / Cancel / Default; a cancelled change keeps the old value | MCM's scale script (`iNewValue` only on Accept) | ok (by the files) |
| Multiple sliders: `_Value1`-`_Value3` and their `Min`/`Max`/`Increment`/`Decimal`, `*:2/_scales` 2 or 3, `*:2/_setting1`-`3` (not for type 9, which is R, G, B 0-255) | MCM's scale script | ok (by the files) |
| Info line: `MCM_Options/_optionID` is the option under the pointer (0 for none or `_enable` 0/2); `*:9/string`, `MCM_Info/visible` | MCM_Options' sum of its rows' `_optionIDX`; `*:9` by place since the fix | fixed |
| Defaults button resets all the mod's options | MCM sets `_Default` 1; the mod's block answers | ok (by the files) |
| Quest-stage result scripts for big menus (`SetStage` with repeated stages) | SetStage runs result scripts | ok |

### 2.5 Drawing

| Guide / MCM item | NVForever | Status |
|---|---|---|
| The mod list's lines one under another (`y` from ArrowUp, `MCM_ModList_Size` height, `_spacing`), a chosen mod's sub-menus under it | MCM's files and list script; laid out by the `locus` rule | ok (CCC's lines: §4) |
| Vanilla UI Plus's traits named with `+` (`_VUI+brightness`, `_VUI+OverwriteVerify`, …) | the reader cut names at the `+`, so they all became one `_VUI`: option titles lost their brightness and VUI+'s self-check showed its "installation error" text over the panel; `+` is part of a name now | fixed |
| A menu's `sibling(name)` (VUI+'s start menu reads `sibling(HUDMainMenu)`) | another menu of that name | fixed |
| Each option's title on its row | Vanilla UI Plus's OptionRect places the title by `<copy src="parent" trait="_y"/>`, a source without brackets; read as a tile named "parent" it gave 0, and every title of a page stood at the top of the screen, one over the other. A bracket-less `parent`, `grandparent`, `child`, `sibling`, `globals`, `screen`, `io` or `strings` is now that source when no tile bears the name (as `me` already was, #2270) [observed: Vanilla UI Plus writes them so 1,739 times for `parent` alone] | fixed |
| Texts drawn with the load order's fonts | a font whose picture is not read is drawn with a stand-in that lost the spaces between words ("ExtraHUD", "Selectamodto…"); and a text's leading spaces (a suffix " seconds" drawn as "6seconds" [observed: Immersive HUD's page, Blue Moon run 2026-11-13]); both are kept now (`fnv_font::Line::text_spaced`) | fixed (the stand-in) |
| MCM Extender's JSON menus in MCM's list | its handler for the start menu's opening (`SetOnMenuOpenEventHandler … 1013`, OnPauseMenuOpen.gek) adds a temporary clone of Caps001 per menu to MCMMods, from names its Script Runner file kept in private auxiliary variables; MCM marks each listed mod by adding it to the container MCMModsListed. Three faults kept them out: the Mods page sent no opening of 1013, the Script Runner file and CompileScript's functions each had their own private variables, and a container refused a clone [observed: Begin Again list 2026-11-13, 3 of 27 mods listed; MCM's script source; MCM Extender's files] | fixed: the page sends 1013's opening and closing (`Game::page_menu_event`), runtime scripts share their private names, a clone of an item goes into containers (`World::add_clone_item`) |
| More than 23 mods in MCM's list | MCM's loop calls SetMCMModList for every mod in MCMMods, past Mod23 too; a row past 23 wrote mod names into SubMenu1 and on, drawn over the top of the list [observed: Begin Again's 27 mods, 2026-11-13; MCM's script source] | fixed: SetMCMModList changes rows 1 to 23 only [hypothesis] |
| MCM Extender's names that are translation keys ("$modDisplayName") | its Script Runner file translates a name whose first character is `$`; that test (`sFilePath[0] == "$"`) is skipped ("Eq of a string and a number") [observed: Begin Again list 2026-11-13] | open (the VM) |
| The load order's fonts whose picture is a `.tex` with no `.dds` (Blue Moon's) | drawn with the stand-in (fonts.md §2.2 reads a `.tex` only beside a `.dds`) | open |

## 3. `_Has360Controller` and MCM's controller mode

MCM's main script reads its rows' and options' clicks only while `iAltInput` (MCM's
`_AltInput`) is 0; with it on, it waits for the keyboard and controller instead
[observed: MCMMainScript's source, `iAltInput == 0 && … "_clicked"`]. MCM 1.5's own file
gives `_AltInput` `&xbox;` (0 on the PC); Vanilla UI Plus's edit of that file copies it from
`globals()`'s `_Has360Controller`, and MCM Extender's patch copies it
from `io()`'s `_controller`, which its StartMenu patch copies from the same global
[observed: the files]. Vanilla UI Plus's `globals.xml` gives `_Has360Controller` 1 with
the note that, unlike `&xbox;`, the game updates it while playing, and its start menu
uses it to follow a controller plugged in or out [observed: the file's comments].
NVForever never wrote it, so the file's 1 stood: MCM was in controller mode and every
click on a mod's line or an option did nothing [observed: run base2, `_AltInput 1`, a
click on "Just Mods" left `_selected` -1]. The engine now writes it each frame on
`globals()` where a file gave it, 1 while a controller is connected and 0 otherwise
(`nvf_play::tiles::write_has_controller`) [hypothesis: connected, not last used].

## 4. JIP Companions Command & Control's sub-menu lines

`crate::jip_ccc` (fnv-game): CCC's MCM script compares `_ActiveMod` with the global
`iJIPCCCModIndex`, which nothing in the plugin writes; at the file's 0 it equals MCM's "no
mod chosen", so CCC switched on `SubMenu1`-`SubMenu3` while no mod was chosen and they
were laid over the first mod lines (MCM places sub-menu lines under the chosen mod, at
`_selected` 0 under none). The global is now written with CCC's own load index when a
game is made [hypothesis: what JIP LN does; the comparison works with no other value].
`iJIPCCCStartup` is left alone (at its ready value CCC calls JIP's own `CCC…` functions,
which NVForever lacks, issue #2271).

## 5. Runs

On the owner's Blue Moon list (MCM 1.5, MCM Extender, Vanilla UI Plus; 211 plugins;
`--data D:\Modlists\ABM\nvf-merged\Data`), Goodsprings, the pause menu's Mods page opened
at 6 s, the pointer aid (`NVF_PLAY_TEST_POINTER`, interface units) on MCM's lines.

- Before (base2): MCM's window opened with 11 mods; the click on "Just Mods" reached the
  row (`clicked 1`) but MCM did nothing (`_AltInput 1`, `_selected` -1, `_ActiveMod` 0);
  the texts ran together.
- After: the click chooses Just Mods (`_ActiveMod 108`, `_AltInput 0`); its 11 options
  fill in on their rows with their check boxes and its 9 sub-menus stand under it; a click
  on Enable Dynamic Crosshair gives MCM's `_Value 0`, `_NewValue 1`, the mod takes it and
  the row reads `_value 0` with its box cleared. The setting is kept in the mod's INI
  (SetModINI): the next run started from 0 and the click set 1. Smoke scenario
  `pause-mods-page-set-value` repeats this on the owner's plain MCM install.
