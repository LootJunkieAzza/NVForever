# JIP PP LN's functions (2026-11-01, #1019)

The ten JIP PP LN functions, built in `crates/fnv-game/src/nvse_jippp.rs`. Sources: the
GECK wiki export [documented: the page named]. JIP PP LN is not installed in the probe
game (the `jip_nvse.dll` there is JIP LN's and names none of these functions
[observed: 2026-11-01]), so nothing here is `[observed]`.

## 1. Runtime node lists

JIP PP LN keeps, for each base form or reference, the list of its InsertNode and
AttachModel calls ("RuntimeNodes") [documented: HasRuntimeNode, CopyRuntimeNodes].
NVForever keeps the same list (`Game::jippp.nodes`): every InsertNode and AttachModel
call (`crate::nif_blocks`) adds its `"Target|Name"` spec, and removes it with modes 0 and
2 [documented: AttachFormModel's addOrRemove table; InsertNode's], with the plugin whose
script called. A spec without `|` is refused (0) and not kept. The scene mirror adds the
node only with modes 1 and 3; a remove leaves the mirror as it is (mode 0 waits for the
3D to load again; mode 2's instant removal of an inserted node is a follow-up).

| Function | NVForever |
|---|---|
| HasRuntimeNode `object query [mode]` | 2 an AttachModel entry, 1 an InsertNode entry, of exactly that spec; 0 any entry whose spec holds the text [documented: the modes; hypothesis: mode 0 by default, exact case] |
| CopyRuntimeNodes `to from [mode]` | 0 replaces `to`'s list with a copy of `from`'s, 1 appends it; 1 when `to` is a form or reference [documented; hypothesis: an empty source succeeds] |
| ClearRuntimeNodes `object` | the calling plugin's entries dropped, the others kept; the number dropped [documented: "Nodes created by other mods are left intact", the `> 0` example]. A reference's inserted nodes go from its drawn tree at once [hypothesis] |
| AttachFormModel `target form mode "node\|suffix"` | `form`'s model (MODL) as an entry under `node` (the root without one), and `form`'s own entries after it, the suffix kept on them; modes 1/3 attach, 0/2 remove; mode 3 on a drawn reference attaches at once (`SceneEdit::Attach`); 1 on success [documented; hypothesis: success is the form having a model, or the entry being there to remove] |

Follow-up: the engine does not yet rename attached blocks with the suffix, or rebuild a
base form's references from the list on their next 3D load.

## 2. The rest

| Function | NVForever |
|---|---|
| GetActiveEffectsInfo `[filter] [temp]` | a list of string maps, one per active effect on the actor: Form, BaseEffect, Caster, MetaData (the effect's id), Magnitude, TimeLeft, Duration, Flags [documented]. Filter 1 enchantments, 2 spells, 3 ingestibles, or a base effect / magic item form; temp 0 permanent only (abilities, worn enchantments), 1 temporary only, 2 both (default) [documented]. Flags 0, and a permanent effect's TimeLeft and Duration 0 [hypothesis: NVForever keeps no effect flags] |
| SetActiveEffectsInfo `array` | each map's Magnitude, TimeLeft (at most the duration) and Duration written to the effect of that MetaData [documented]; a per-second value change scales with the magnitude [hypothesis; follow-up: a modifier already applied keeps its amount] |
| GetCalculatedWeaponDegradation `[weapon] [ammo]` | health points lost per shot: the WEAP override (DNAM flags2 bit 7) else fDamageToWeaponValue, then the ammunition's Weapon Condition Mod effects in order (combat-rules.md §17). Without arguments the actor's weapon and the ammunition it uses [documented: the examples]; with a weapon and no ammunition, the weapon's own (NAM0) [hypothesis] |
| GetControlCodeByID `control type` | type 0 the key, 1 the mouse button as GetControl gives it (256 + n) [documented: the types; hypothesis: the mouse code's form]; 2 and 3 −1 [decision: NVForever binds no controller or joystick to the controls] |
| ClampToGround | waits for the engine, which knows the ground (`Game::take_clamp_requests`) [documented: the page; follow-up: the engine does not take it yet] |
| RefreshInventoryWeight | nothing [decision: NVForever reckons the carried weight at each read, `World::carried_weight`] |
