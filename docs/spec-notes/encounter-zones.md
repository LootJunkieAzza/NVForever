# Spec notes: encounter zones and the level of leveled lists

ESM gap audit 2026-10-21, priority 1 (`docs/handoff/esm-gap-audit-2026-10-21.md`). Built in
`fnv_sim::zones` (rules), `fnv_game::zones` (cell loads), `fnv_actor::resolve` (drawn
actors, `resolve_changed_at`), `engine/nvforever/src/zones.rs` (the engine's copy).

## 1. Data

- **ECZN** `DATA`, 8 bytes: owner (FormID, NPC_ or FACT), rank (i8), minimum level (i8),
  flags (u8: bit 0 "Never Resets", bit 1 "Match PC Below Minimum Level"), one unused byte
  [documented: xEdit wbDefinitionsFNV.pas ECZN; GECK wiki GetZoneFlag/SetZoneFlag name the
  two bits]. Schema `world.json` ECZN.
  [observed: FalloutNV.esm has 17 ECZN, every `DATA` 8 bytes, owner 0 in all, rank 0 or
  −1, minimum levels 0–22, flags 0 or 1 (no zone sets bit 1).] Examples: Vault3Zone 12,
  RepconHQZone 10, HooverDamZone 10, Vault11Zone 6, BisonSteve 2, GomorrahZone 22.
- **XEZN** (FormID of an ECZN) on CELL, WRLD and placed references (REFR, ACHR, ACRE, …)
  [documented: xEdit; schema `common.json`]. [observed: FalloutNV.esm has it on 84 cells,
  5 ACHR and 11 ACRE (most of the HELIOS One robots), on no WRLD.]
- **XLCM** "Level Modifier" (i32) on placed leveled actors [documented: xEdit wbXLCM]; the
  GECK's Leveled Actor tab offers None, Easy, Medium, Hard, Boss [documented: GECK wiki
  Reference]. [observed: values 0–3 on 297 placed actors of FalloutNV.esm; read as 0 Easy,
  1 Medium, 2 Hard, 3 Very Hard (Boss) after xEdit's enum; no XLCM is "None".]
- **A reference's zone**: its own XEZN, else its cell's, else its worldspace's
  (`RefTable::zone_of`, `cell_zone`) [documented: GECK wiki Reference, "What Encounter
  Zone is this reference attached to?"; hypothesis: the order, and that a worldspace's
  zone covers cells naming none]. The authored cell counts, not where the actor walked to.

## 2. A zone's level

- Set **the first time the player enters it** and kept for good [documented: GECK wiki
  Bethsoft Tutorial NPC population, "When the player enters an encounter zone for the first
  time, the level of that zone is set permanently"].
- The level: the player's level, raised to the zone's minimum [documented: same page, "if
  a second-level player enters an Encounter Zone with a min. level of 10, leveled lists in
  the Zone will spawn actors as though the player were level 10"]. With "Match PC Below
  Minimum Level" a player under the minimum gets the zone at their own level [hypothesis:
  read from the flag's name; no FNV zone sets it]. No maximum level (FNV's ECZN has none).
- "Entering" is the zone's cell coming into the game's loaded cells (the player's cell, or
  the 5 × 5 around it outdoors; `Game::set_loaded`) [hypothesis: the game makes a cell's
  leveled actors when it loads them]. A reference with a zone of its own enters that zone
  when its cell loads.
- Saved: `fnv.sim.state/1` `zone_levels` (absent when empty).

## 3. The level a placed reference reads leveled lists at

- Its zone's level; with no zone, the player's level [documented: GECK wiki Reference,
  Leveled Actor: "If there is no encounter zone, which is common in the wasteland, the
  player's level is used"].
- Changed by XLCM [documented: GECK wiki Reference]: Easy 50 % "All entries in the leveled
  list at or below that level are available"; Medium 75 %, Hard 125 %, Boss 200 % "Only
  the closest entry in the leveled list, without exceeding the value, will be selected";
  None "A random entry equal to or below the calculated level".
  [hypothesis: rounded down, never below 1. Easy forces "all levels"; None, Medium, Hard
  and Boss keep the list's own "Calculate from all levels" flag (the wiki's None and
  Medium/Hard/Boss texts read like the flag on and off; the list's flag is kept because
  the leveled-item captures, simulation.md §4, show the flag deciding).]
- The level is **fixed for the reference when its cell first loads**
  (`World::fix_level`, saved as `ref_levels`) [hypothesis: an actor made at a load stays
  the same actor after the player levels up, until its cell is reset]. Before that, the
  rules give the level the load would fix (its zone's level, or the level the zone would
  take now, or the player's level), so a query before the load agrees with it.
- What reads it: the actor a placed leveled actor list (LVLN/LVLC) stands for, and every
  `TPLT` chain through a list (factions, packages, name, scripts, actor values, spells,
  `fnv_game::templates`; the drawn actor, `fnv_actor::resolve`; the same seed as before,
  so only the level changes the pick); and the carried items of placed actors and
  containers (leveled item lists, `World::roll_inventory`) [documented: GECK wiki
  LeveledItem: in a container the player's level; "on an actor ... the actor's level";
  hypothesis: both are read as the reference's level here — a zone's level for a
  container in a zone, the modified level for an actor; the actor's own level (PC level
  multiplier, `Game::actor_level`) is not used for its items].
- A cell reset (`fnv_game::respawn`) fixes the level of the actors it brings back again,
  at the player's level then (a zone's level does not change); refilled containers too.
- Not changed: references made at run time (PlaceAtMe, PlaceLeveledActorAtMe) read at
  the configured player level as before; scripts' AddItem of a leveled list reads the
  configured player level. The static viewer (no `--play`) keeps the display level 1.

## 4. Never Resets

- A cell whose zone has "Never Resets" is never reset: its dead Respawn actors stay dead
  and its respawning containers keep what they hold (`World::attach_cell`,
  `Game::cell_entered`) [documented: GECK wiki SetZoneRespawns, "Creatures will no longer
  respawn in the Yao Gaui Den zone"; GECK wiki Reference, references "will respawn
  according to the Encounter Zone setting"]. The zone's own level never resets either way
  (§2). SetZoneRespawns itself is not built (no opcode in the catalogue).

## 5. Engine

- The engine draws actors from its own copy of the records; `zones.rs` copies the game's
  level of every placed actor (`Game::leveled_at`) into `ActorWorld::levels` whenever a
  zone was entered, references were fixed, or the player's level changed, and the drawn
  actor is resolved at it (`resolve_changed_at`, `resolve_creature_at`). Without `--play`
  every actor is drawn at the display level 1 as before.
- Log lines (`nvf-play` script runtime, at each cell change): `zones: encounter zone
  <EDID> (<id>) entered: level L (minimum M, player level P)`, and for each placed leveled
  list in a zone `zones: leveled actor <ref> (<list>) at level L[ (all levels)] in zone
  <EDID> stands for <base> (<base at level 1, or "the same"> at level 1)` (outside zones
  at debug level). Smoke scenario `encounter-zone-level`.

## 6. Functions

- `GetInZone zone` (0x11BE): 1 when the calling reference's current cell has the zone
  (CELL XEZN, else its worldspace's) [documented: GECK wiki GetInZone; hypothesis: a
  reference's own XEZN does not count, the wiki speaks of cells].

## 7. Not built, open

- Leveled locks: REFR XLOC "Leveled" [documented: GECK wiki Bethsoft Tutorial Non-NPC
  population, "The 'leveled' checkbox in the lock tab is a deprecated feature: leave it
  unchecked"; Reference: "will start at the base level specified and become harder as
  the player levels" — no rule for how much is documented]. Built 2026-10-24 with a
  guessed rule from the reference's level (simulation.md §5).
- The game settings that bound how far below the level an entry may be
  (`iLevItemLevelDifferenceMax` and the like) are not read; the "highest eligible level"
  pool makes them matter only with "Calculate from all levels".
- Zone ownership (owner, rank) is read but unused (crime rules).
- Captures wanted: a zone's level after leaving and coming back at a higher level
  (level-design.md §13 item 9); whether XLCM Medium/Hard/Boss ignore the list's flag;
  whether an actor outside zones re-rolls on level-up without a cell reset.
