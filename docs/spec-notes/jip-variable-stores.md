# Spec note: JIP variable stores (auxiliary variables and RefMap arrays)

JIP LN NVSE keeps two named stores outside script variables: **auxiliary variables**
(named lists of values owned by a form or a reference) and **RefMap arrays** (named
maps from forms to values). Task J2 of [jip-tasks.md](../handoff/jip-tasks.md); input
for J5.

Wiki statements are `[documented: <page>]` (private export `C:\fnv-private\geckwiki\`, in
our own words). The concept pages *Auxiliary Variables*, *RefMap Array* and
*Template:ModIndexOverride* are **not in the export** [observed]. So the name rules below
come from the game: `[observed: jip-stores/<id>]`, runtime-compiled probes on the player
(`tools/capture/jip_probes.py --set jip-stores`, JIP 57.30, 2026-10-26, 32 rows, the 17
documented values all match; golden private).

## 1. Auxiliary variables

A variable is a name plus an owner (a reference, or the base form given as the last
argument), holding an ordered list of elements. Each element is a float, a reference or
a string [documented: AuxiliaryVariableGetType].

| Function (alias) | Arguments after the name | Returns | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| AuxiliaryVariableSetFloat (AuxVarSetFlt), …SetRef (AuxVarSetRef), …SetString (AuxVarSetStr) | value; index (default 0; -1 appends); base form (optional) | success | sets an element [documented: AuxiliaryVariableSetFloat] |
| AuxiliaryVariableGetFloat (AuxVarGetFlt), …GetRef, …GetString | index (default 0; -1 the last); base form | the value | 0 when the variable, the index or the type does not match [documented: AuxiliaryVariableGetFloat] |
| AuxiliaryVariableGetType (AuxVarType) | index; base form | 0 none, 1 float, 2 reference, 4 string | [documented: AuxiliaryVariableGetType] |
| AuxiliaryVariableGetSize (AuxVarSize) | base form | element count, 0 if undefined | [documented: AuxiliaryVariableGetSize] |
| AuxiliaryVariableErase (AuxVarErase) | index (missing or -1: the whole variable); base form | the new element count | [documented: AuxiliaryVariableErase] |
| AuxiliaryVariableGetAll (AuxVarGetAll) | class 0–3; base form | a string map: variable name → its values | classes: 0 permanent-private, 1 temporary-private, 2 permanent-public, 3 temporary-public [documented: AuxiliaryVariableGetAll] |
| AuxiliaryVariableGetAsArray (AuxVarGetAsArr) | base form | array of the values | [documented] |
| AuxVarGetFltCond | quest, string-variable index | element 0 as a float | a condition function: the name comes from a string variable of the quest's script [documented: AuxVarGetFltCond] |

Observed rules:
- Set and get round-trip floats and strings: 3.5 and "abc" [observed: aux.float,
  aux.string]. Appending with index -1 grows the list (three sets give size 3), and index
  -1 reads the last element [observed: aux.append.size, aux.last].
- **Setting an index beyond the end does nothing**: index 5 on an undefined variable
  leaves size 0 [observed: aux.gap.size].
- Setting a different type at an index replaces the element, type included: float then
  string gives type 4 [observed: aux.overwrite.type]. Reading a float from a string
  element gives 0 [observed: aux.float.of.string].
- Missing: GetFloat 0, GetType 0, GetSize 0 [observed: aux.missing.*].
- Erasing one element returns the new count (2 of 3), and later elements move down
  (element 0 is then the old element 1) [observed: aux.erase.returns, aux.erase.shifts].
  **Erasing the whole variable returns -1** [observed: aux.erase.all]. The page only says
  "the new number of elements".
- **Names ignore case**: "*NVFc" reads "*nvfC" [observed: aux.case].
- **Owners are separate**: a variable set on Doc Mitchell's base form is not seen on the
  player reference (base 7, player 0) [observed: aux.owner.base].
- **Prefix `*` selects the temporary classes**. A name without it shows up in classes 0
  and 2 (permanent); with `*` it shows up in 1 and 3 (temporary) [observed:
  aux.class.nvfP = bits 0+2, aux.class.tnvfP = bits 1+3]. A leading `_` (`_nvfP`,
  `*_nvfP`) changed nothing here [observed: aux.class.unvfP, aux.class.tunvfP].
  Private/public was not separable from a runtime-compiled script: each variable showed
  in both its private and its public class. [hypothesis: private means "owned by the
  calling script's mod", and a runtime-compiled script belongs to no plugin; the missing
  ModIndexOverride template probably explains it.] **Owner review:** export *Auxiliary
  Variables*, *RefMap Array* and *Template:ModIndexOverride*, or a GECK-compiled probe
  from a plugin, settles the private/public rule.
- Temporary means not written to the save [documented by the class names; persistence
  not probed: it needs a save and a reload].

## 2. RefMap arrays

A RefMap is a named map whose keys are forms or references (the calling reference, or
the base form given last) and whose values are a float, a form or a string
[documented: RefMapArrayGetType].

| Function (alias) | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| RefMapArraySetFloat (RefMapSetFlt), …SetRef, …SetString | sets the key's value, creating the entry [documented: RefMapArraySetFloat] |
| RefMapArrayGetFloat (RefMapGetFlt), …GetRef, …GetString | the key's value; 0 when the map, the key or the type does not match [documented: RefMapArrayGetFloat] |
| RefMapArrayGetType (RefMapGetType) | 0 none, 1 float, 2 form, 4 string [documented] |
| RefMapArrayGetSize (RefMapSize), RefMapArrayGetKeys (RefMapKeys), RefMapArrayGetAll (RefMapGetAll) | count, keys array, everything [documented: their pages] |
| RefMapArrayGetFirst (RefMapFirst), RefMapArrayGetNext (RefMapNext) | a two-element array [key, value]; Next continues from the last First/Next call and gives ar_Null after the last pair [documented: RefMapArrayGetNext] |
| RefMapArrayErase (RefMapErase), RefMapArrayDestroy (RefMapDestroy) | removes a key / the whole map [documented] |
| RefMapArrayValidate (RefMapValidate) | removes keys whose references no longer exist and returns the new size [documented] |

Observed: set/get 4.5; two sets on the same key keep one entry (player twice plus Doc
Mitchell = size 2); GetType of a string 4; missing type and float 0; First's key is the
player (00000014); Keys has 2 entries; First has 2 elements, and **Next after the last
pair gives ar_Null, whose ar_Size is -1**; a destroyed map has size 0; Validate on a
live key returns 1 [observed: refmap.*]. The wiki's own loop example uses a `*` name
("*SomeRefMap") [documented: RefMapArrayGetNext], so the prefix rule of §1 probably
applies to RefMaps too [hypothesis].

## 3. For NVForever (J5)

- One store per save, per owner form ID, per lower-cased name. Keep the `*`
  (temporary) entries out of the save, and save the others in NVForever's own save
  section. Never write JIP's co-save: NVForever writes no files the original game reads
  (install-layout.md).
- Iteration order of RefMap keys, GetAll and GetKeys is not documented. NVForever uses
  insertion order [decision; not observed: each probe used one or two keys].
- The not-probed setters AuxiliaryVariableSetFromArray, AuxiliaryVariableEraseAll and
  RefMapArrayErase follow their pages.
