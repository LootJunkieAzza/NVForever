# Spec note: dialogue voice files

Clean-room description in plain language (docs/design/dialogue.md step D3). The reader is
`crates/fnv-voice`, playback is `engine/nvf-play/src/voice.rs`. Confidence tags:
**[documented]** cites a public source, **[observed]** was checked on the owner's install
(FNV 1.4.0.525, Steam, English, the ten masters and their archives), **[hypothesis]**
needs verification.

How the observations were made (2026-10-10): the file listings of all archives
(`fnvtool bsa list`) were matched against the DIAL, INFO, QUST, VTYP, NPC_, CREA and TACT
records of the ten masters, first with throw-away scripts and then by
`fnvtool voice coverage` (`fnv.voice.coverage/1`), which reproduces every count below
and is repeated as a test (`crates/fnv-voice/tests/real_data.rs`, run when
`NVFOREVER_DATA` is set). No listing, sound or text is kept in the repository.

Sources: xEdit record definitions as recorded in `schemas/fnv/gameplay.json` and
`placed.json` (field names and offsets); RFC 3533 (the Ogg container); the Vorbis I
specification (xiph.org); Microsoft's "Multimedia Programming Interface and Data
Specifications 1.0" (RIFF WAVE); GECK wiki Category:Dialogue as quoted in
quests-dialogue.md §4.

## 1. Where the files are

- Every voice file is in an archive, under `sound\voice\`. No loose voice file exists in
  the owner's `Data` folder [observed].
- 122,032 voice files in five archives [observed]:

  | Archive | Plugin folder | `.ogg` | `.lip` | `.wav` |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `Fallout - Voices1.bsa` | `falloutnv.esm` | 52,896 | 52,581 | 40 |
  | `DeadMoney - Main.bsa` | `deadmoney.esm` | 2,795 | 2,558 | – |
  | `HonestHearts - Main.bsa` | `honesthearts.esm` | 2,277 | 2,263 | – |
  | `OldWorldBlues - Main.bsa` | `oldworldblues.esm` | 2,199 | 2,177 | – |
  | `LonesomeRoad - Main.bsa` | `lonesomeroad.esm` | 1,123 | 1,123 | – |
  | total | | 61,290 | 60,702 | 40 |

  `Fallout - Voices1.bsa` holds nothing else. The add-ons keep their voices in
  `<plugin> - Main.bsa`, next to meshes and textures; their `<plugin> - Sounds.bsa` hold
  `sound\fx` and `sound\songs` only [observed]. Gun Runners' Arsenal and the four pack
  plugins have no voice files; they add no dialogue line of their own (Gun Runners'
  Arsenal overrides ten base-game lines, §3.4) [observed].
- One more file sits under `sound\voice`: `sound\voice\empty.txt` in four of the add-on
  `Main` archives (a placeholder; not a voice file) [observed].
- The archives are found by the usual precedence (bsa.md, "Precedence"); no voice path
  is in more than one archive [observed].

## 2. The path

`sound\voice\<plugin>\<voice type>\<quest>_<topic>_<form id>_<response>.<ext>`, all in
lower case in the archives [observed].

Of the 61,290 sounds, 61,109 are named exactly this way by a response of a line of the
ten masters; the other 181 are leftovers (§3.3). The parts:

### 2.1 Folders

- `<plugin>`: the file name of the plugin that owns the line's FormID, with its
  extension (`falloutnv.esm`) [observed: all five folders; every sound of an add-on line
  is in the add-on's folder, also when the line sits in a base-game topic such as
  GREETING].
- `<voice type>`: the Editor ID of a voice type record (VTYP). All 130 voice folders
  (81 base game, 6, 14, 24 and 5 in the add-ons; 129 different names) are Editor IDs of
  VTYP records; 24 of the 153 voice types have no folder [observed].

### 2.2 Quest and topic

`<quest>` is the Editor ID of the line's quest (INFO `QSTI`), `<topic>` the Editor ID of
the topic (DIAL) whose "topic children" group holds the line [observed]:

- When `<quest>_<topic>` is at most 26 characters long, both are kept whole
  [observed: 15,142 sounds, among them 12,020 whose quest ID is longer than 10
  characters; 5,700 of those are exactly 26 long].
- Otherwise the quest ID is cut to its first 10 characters and the topic ID to what is
  left of the 26 (15 characters after a 10-character quest, more after a shorter one)
  [observed: 45,990 sounds; with a quest ID longer than 10, totals of 27 characters
  (1,221 sounds) are already cut; a quest ID of 5 characters leaves the topic 20].
- Nothing else occurs: of the 61,142 sounds whose FormID is a line of their plugin and
  whose name has the pattern's shape, 61,132 follow these two rules and ten carry a stale
  name (§3.3) [observed]. Why 26 and 10 is not known [hypothesis: a fixed-size name
  buffer in the original tools].

Different topics of one quest can share the cut text; the FormID keeps the names apart.

### 2.3 FormID and response number

- `<form id>`: the line's FormID as eight lower-case hex digits **with the load-order
  byte zeroed**: add-on lines (FormIDs 01…–04… in the default load order) are stored as
  `00……` [observed: all 5,647 different FormIDs in add-on file names start with `00`]. So a file
  name does not depend on where its plugin loads.
- `<response>`: the response number of the INFO's `TRDT` (byte 12; xEdit "Response
  number") in decimal, without padding [documented: the field; observed: as the last part
  of the name]. Numbers run from 1 to 31; 120 sounds have a two-digit number [observed].
  The number is not the position in the record: 874 of 28,887 lines with responses store
  them in another order than 1…n, or skip numbers (for example 2, 1) [observed].

### 2.4 Extension

`.ogg` for the sound, `.lip` for its lip-sync data (same name), and for 40 base-game
sounds a `.wav` copy next to the `.ogg` (§4).

## 3. Lines against files

28,896 lines (INFO, winning definitions) with 37,403 responses; 9 lines have no response
[observed].

### 3.1 How many resolve

A response "has a sound" when at least one voice folder of its plugin holds its `.ogg`
[observed]:

| Plugin | Lines | Responses | With a sound | Share |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FalloutNV.esm | 23,247 | 29,674 | 28,767 | 96.9 % |
| DeadMoney.esm | 2,126 | 2,765 | 2,729 | 98.7 % |
| HonestHearts.esm | 1,236 | 1,664 | 1,653 | 99.3 % |
| OldWorldBlues.esm | 1,620 | 2,165 | 2,134 | 98.6 % |
| LonesomeRoad.esm | 667 | 1,135 | 1,120 | 98.7 % |
| all ten masters | 28,896 | 37,403 | 36,403 | **97.3 %** |

For the 22,589 responses of lines with a fixed speaker (INFO `ANAM`), the file can be
checked in that speaker's own voice folder (§7): 22,252 have it there, 317 have no file
in any voice, 15 have a file only in another voice's folder, and 5 belong to speakers
(creatures) without a voice type [observed].

### 3.2 Several voices, or none

- A response has one file per voice type that can say it, each in that voice type's
  folder. No file is shared between voice types: there is no common folder and no
  redirection [observed]. 31,861 responses have a sound in one voice folder, 4,542 in two
  or more (lines many actors share; up to 32 voices) [observed].
- 1,000 responses have no sound in any voice. They are spread over 108 quests, most in
  test and debug quests (`vDialogueTestaclesDebug` 289, `VDialogueTEST` 64), robots and
  radios (`HD00RobotsDialog` 50, `RadioBlackMountain` 38) [observed]. 165 of them name a
  sound form instead (§6). What the game does for a line without a file (how long it
  shows the subtitle) is [hypothesis: not captured]; the runtime keeps its fitted length
  (§8).

### 3.3 Sounds no line names

181 of the 61,290 sounds [observed]:

- 138 carry a FormID that is no line of their plugin (lines deleted after recording);
- 33 carry the FormID of a line but another name: 10 with the quest and topic the line
  had before it was moved (for example a Freeside line recorded under its old quest), and
  23 with a response number the line no longer has;
- 10 have names outside the pattern (suffixes such as `_alt`, `_og`, `old`, a trailing
  space, a missing response number).

The reader never finds these, as the game presumably does not [hypothesis].

### 3.4 Lines a later plugin overrides

37 base-game lines are redefined by a later master (Dead Money 25, Gun Runners' Arsenal
10, Honest Hearts 2). All 37 have their sounds in the base game's folder; the overriding
plugins' folders hold none for them [observed]. The
reader looks in the folder of the plugin that owns the FormID only
[hypothesis: whether the game would prefer a file in the overriding plugin's folder is
untested, since none exists].

## 4. File types

- **`.ogg`**: Ogg Vorbis. All 61,109 sounds that lines name were read: 51,927 at 24,000
  Hz, 7,842 at 22,050 Hz, 1,162 at 48,000 Hz and 178 at 44,100 Hz; 59,674 mono and 1,435
  stereo; together 253,944 s (70.5 hours); the longest 40.85 s, the shortest 0 samples
  [observed].
- **`.wav`**: 40 files, all in `maleuniquepresident` (the `VHDKimballSpeech` quest), each
  next to an `.ogg` of the same name, with the same sample rate, channel count and
  length as its `.ogg` (within 1 ms) [observed]. The one looked at closely is 16-bit PCM
  with a `bext` chunk before `fmt ` [observed]. Which of the two the game plays is [hypothesis: unknown]; the reader takes
  the `.ogg` [decision: same length, and the engine's audio decodes Ogg Vorbis].
- **`.lip`**: lip-sync data, one per sound for 60,702 of the 61,290 sounds; none without
  its sound [observed]. Not decoded (out of scope, dialogue.md §7).

## 5. Length from the headers

Nothing is decoded to measure a file (`fnv_voice::length`):

- **Ogg Vorbis.** An Ogg file is a chain of pages: the capture pattern `OggS`, a version
  byte, a header-type byte, a 64-bit granule position, the stream serial number, a page
  sequence number, a checksum, a segment count and table, then the segments
  [documented: RFC 3533 §6]. The first packet is the Vorbis identification header: packet
  type 1, the letters `vorbis`, a 32-bit version (0), the channel count (1 byte) and the
  sample rate (32 bits) [documented: Vorbis I specification §4.2.2]. A page's granule
  position is the count of samples decoded when the last packet ending on that page is
  done; −1 means no packet ends on the page [documented: Vorbis I §A.2, RFC 3533 §6].
  **Length = granule position of the last page that has one ÷ sample rate.** Checksums
  are not verified; a file cut short keeps the last whole page's count.
- **WAV.** RIFF chunks; `fmt ` gives format, channels, sample rate, bytes per second and
  block align, `data` the samples [documented: RIFF WAVE]. PCM: `data` size ÷ block align
  ÷ sample rate. Other formats: the `fact` chunk's sample count when present, else `data`
  size ÷ bytes per second. Chunks before `data` (such as `bext`) are skipped.

Check [observed]: both readers give 125,359 samples (5.223 s) for the first Kimball line's
`.wav` and `.ogg`; the 40 pairs agree.

## 6. The sound field of a response

- `TRDT` bytes 16–19 name a sound form (xEdit "Sound", SOUN) [documented: xEdit,
  `gameplay.json`]. 228 responses of the masters set it, pointing at 97 SOUN records,
  whose file name is a folder for 108 of the responses, an `.mp3` for 111 and a `.wav`
  for 9 (among them creature and robot noises) [observed]. 63 of the 228 also have
  a voice file [observed].
- The editor describes it as an optional sound played instead of the voice
  [documented: GECK wiki Category:Dialogue, quests-dialogue.md §4]. Whether it replaces
  the voice file when both exist, and how long such a line lasts, is [hypothesis: not
  captured]. The reader reports the form (`sound_form` in `fnv.voice.line/1`) and does
  not play or measure it.
- `SNDD` ("Unused" in xEdit) occurs in no INFO of the masters [observed].

## 7. Who speaks with which voice

- An NPC's or creature's voice type is its `VTCK`; a talking activator's (TACT) is its
  `VNAM` [documented: xEdit "Voice" / "Voice Type"]. All 4,220 NPC_ records, 1,542 of
  2,235 creatures and 101 of 132 talking activators have one [observed].
- An actor whose template supplies its Traits (`ACBS` template flags bit 0, with a
  `TPLT`) takes the template's voice type, as it takes race and sex
  [documented: xEdit hides these fields under the flag, actors.md §1]. When the template
  is a levelled list the actual actor is chosen at run time; the reader then uses the
  record's own voice type [hypothesis].
- The game chooses the folder from the speaker's voice type at run time. The reader does
  the same and does not fall back to another voice's file (§3.1's 15 responses then have
  no sound) [hypothesis].

## 8. Line length in the runtime

`fnv-game` has a hook (`fnv_game::voice::VoiceLengths`, `Game::voice`): when set, a
response lasts as long as its voice file for the speaker's voice type; a response
without a file, and every response when the hook is not set, keeps the fitted length
(1.1 s + 1/16 s per character, scripts.md §7.7). A line lasts the sum of its responses.
`fnv_voice::VoiceBank` implements the hook; `fnvtool script run` sets it by default
(`--no-voice-lengths` or `FNVTOOL_VOICE_LENGTHS=0` keep the fitted length) and
`nvforever --play` sets it once the index is built (`NVF_PLAY_VOICE_LENGTHS=0` keeps
the fitted length).

**Doc Mitchell's intro lines** (headless walk-through,
`crates/fnv-game/walkthrough/intro.actions.json`; all 23 are single responses in
`maleuniquedocmitchell`) [observed: file headers]:

| Line (INFO) | Characters | Fitted s | Sound s | | Line (INFO) | Characters | Fitted s | Sound s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00104BEE | 29 | 2.91 | 2.61 | | 0x00104BFC | 34 | 3.23 | 2.78 |
| 0x00104BEF | 63 | 5.04 | 5.59 | | 0x001074A2 | 122 | 8.72 | 9.55 |
| 0x00104BF0 | 53 | 4.41 | 3.04 | | 0x00104BED | 102 | 7.47 | 5.79 |
| 0x00104BF1 | 77 | 5.91 | 5.87 | | 0x0010749C | 35 | 3.29 | 1.95 |
| 0x00104BF2 | 92 | 6.85 | 5.70 | | 0x001055AD | 84 | 6.35 | 3.50 |
| 0x00104BF3 | 41 | 3.66 | 3.14 | | 0x001055AE | 117 | 8.41 | 6.25 |
| 0x00104BF6 | 113 | 8.16 | 6.97 | | 0x0010586A | 56 | 4.60 | 3.07 |
| 0x00104BF7 | 88 | 6.60 | 5.77 | | 0x0010586B | 79 | 6.04 | 3.98 |
| 0x00104BF8 | 11 | 1.79 | 0.88 | | 0x0010586C | 99 | 7.29 | 6.09 |
| 0x00104BF9 | 58 | 4.72 | 3.61 | | 0x001057EE | 38 | 3.48 | 2.35 |
| 0x00104BFA | 84 | 6.35 | 7.03 | | 0x001057EF | 31 | 3.04 | 1.48 |
| 0x00104BFB | 94 | 6.97 | 6.44 | | all 23 | | 125.29 | 103.45 |

**Stage timings** (seconds from the stage before, headless walk-through; capture:
scripts.md §9, layer5-captures.md §10.2–10.3). `nvforever --play --new-game` gives the
same steps within 0.05 s for both lengths (docs/design/layer5-play.md §6.2, §6.4),
except 60 → 65, which its test aid times:

| Span (lines) | Capture | Fitted | Sound | Sound − capture |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VCG01 3 → 5 (1 line) | 2.9 | 2.90 | 2.60 | −0.3 |
| 8 → 10 (3 lines) | 15.4 | 15.37 | 14.52 | −0.9 |
| 15 → 25 (2 lines) | not timed | 10.50 | 8.85 | |
| 25 → 30 (2 lines) | not timed | 14.77 | 12.77 | |
| 35 → 36 (1 line) | a line | 1.78 | 0.87 | |
| 40 → 45 (2 lines) | not timed | 11.13 | 10.70 | |
| 50 → 55 (2 lines) | about 10 | 10.20 | 9.22 | about −0.8 |
| 60 → 65 (1 line; trigger by input) | about 10 | 8.75 | 9.57 | about −0.4 |
| 70 → 75 (1 line) | not timed | 7.47 | 5.78 | |
| 79 → 80 (3 lines) | about 13 | 18.07 | 11.73 | about −1.3 |
| 95 → 98 (3 lines) | not timed | 17.93 | 13.15 | |
| 105 → 110 (1 line) | not timed | 3.47 | 2.35 | |

What this shows [observed]: the sound lengths remove the fit's large errors (the psych
intro, 18.1 s against about 13 s), and every timed span now comes out **short by about
0.3 to 0.4 s per line** (−0.3 for one line, −0.9 for three, about −0.8 for two, about
−0.4 for one, about −1.3 for three). The fit had absorbed that. The cause is [hypothesis]: a pause the game leaves
after a sound before the end result script runs, or the time it takes to start one.
Nothing was tuned to close it: it needs a capture that times single lines (owner review;
dialogue.md §6 question 4). Which stage follows which, and by what, is unchanged.

**Lab.** The four `L5.intro.*` scenarios pass with both lengths, with identical
observations: their timed steps are timers, not spans of lines [observed].

## 9. Playback (`nvforever --play`)

`engine/nvf-play/src/voice.rs`: each response of a line being said (`Game::speech`:
SayTo and Say today) has its file read from the archive and played through Bevy's audio
when it starts; subtitles switch with the responses; a line that is cut (another line by
the same speaker, the speaker disabled, deleted or dead) has its sound stopped. One log
line per sound: `voice: playing <path> (<seconds> s) <speaker> line <INFO> response <n>`;
a response without a file logs `voice: no file ...`. `--no-voice` plays nothing (lengths
and log stay), `--voice-volume <x>` scales the volume.

Not done [decision]: 3D placement and distance (voices play flat), pausing the sound
with the pause menu or a script's menu (script time stops there, the sound plays on),
the response's sound form (§6), lip sync and emotions.

## 10. Tools

- `fnvtool voice line <data> <plugins…> --info <FormID> [--speaker <Editor ID|FormID>]`
  (`fnv.voice.line/1`): quest, topic, the file name of each response, every voice type
  that has it (path, archive, sample rate, length, lip file) and the file the speaker
  says it with (default: the line's fixed speaker); the line's length when every response
  has a file.
- `fnvtool voice coverage <data> <plugins…> [--lengths]` (`fnv.voice.coverage/1`): the
  counts of this note; `--lengths` reads every sound's headers (about 10 s).
- `fnvtool voice length <file…>` (`fnv.voice.length/1`): the headers of loose `.ogg` or
  `.wav` files.

## 11. Open

- The 0.3 to 0.4 s per line between a sound's length and the captured spans (§8).
- `.ogg` or `.wav` first when both exist (§4); the sound form of a response (§6); a line
  without any file (§3.2).
- Voice type of actors templated on a levelled list (§7); whether another voice type's
  file is ever used (§3.1).
- Whether the game looks in an overriding plugin's folder (§3.4), and whether loose
  files replace archive files for voices (bsa.md, "Precedence").
- Say's `is2D` and `isVoice` parameters (script-functions-catalogue.md) and distance
  attenuation: not read.
