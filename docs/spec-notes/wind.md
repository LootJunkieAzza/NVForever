# Wind on loose bodies: the tumbleweeds

How the weather's wind moves bodies in NVForever, and what the original was seen to do.
Issue #1401. Code: `engine/nvforever/src/tumble.rs` (the wind), `crates/fnv-phys`
`PhysWorld::wind_refs` / `PhysWorld::blow` (the bodies), `crates/fnv-collide`
`CollisionObject::wind` (the flag).

## 1. Which bodies

- **The flag.** A rigid body's Body Flags: "1 = respond to wind" [documented: niftools
  nif.xml, bhkRigidBody, field Body Flags]. NVForever reads bit 0 of the field
  (`schemas/nif/havok.json` `body_flags`).
- **Who sets it.** Three of the base archive's 12,941 collision objects:
  `clutter\tumbleweednv.nif`, `effects\tumbleweedpile.nif` and
  `clutter\nv_caesarthrone\nv_caesarthrone.nif` [observed: `fnvtool collide objects`
  over `Fallout - Meshes.bsa`, its `wind` column, 2026-11-06].
- **Placed tumbleweeds.** FalloutNV.esm places 52 references of the MSTT `TumbleweedNV`
  (all persistent, in WastelandNV's persistent cell, most around Goodsprings and along
  the road south) and 4 of the ACTI `TumbleweedRanch01` [observed: `fnvtool world refs
  --world WastelandNV`]. The three tumbleweed creatures (`NVCRTumbleweed`,
  `NVCRTumbleweedBaby`, `NVCRTumbleweedRad`) are placed nowhere in the masters: no ACRE
  and no leveled list names them [observed: FalloutNV.esm, the creatures' FormIDs appear
  only in their own records and one XNAM], so what the owner saw blowing are the MSTT
  clutter.
- **Scripted.** The Goodsprings intro pushes one tumbleweed: Doc Mitchell's trigger
  script enables `StartingTumbleweedREF`, forces `NVWastelandClearWindy` and 8 s later
  places `vSmallImpulseExplosion` at `VCG01TumbleweedImpulseREF`
  ("VCG01RemoveDocCarebearModeTriggerSCRIPT" [documented: its source in FalloutNV.esm]);
  that explosion's force moves it as any explosion does.

## 2. What the original does [observed: campaign o27_tumble, `nvfairport` save, 2026-11-06]

The observer tracked ten `TumbleweedNV` references around the `coc Goodsprings` spot
(-72151, 643) and one far away (0x00178A76 at (2760, -86718)) by FormID, a sample about
every 0.11 s, for 30 s in each of `NVWastelandClear` (WTHR DATA wind speed 50),
`HVDustStorm` (127) and `WastelandNorth` (25), forced in that order in one game.

- **After the load** (the first 30 s, NVWastelandClear) four of the ten were rolling:
  0x00178A64 went 701 units net (1,012 along its path) at 150–210 units a second towards
  326–352° (clockwise from north), climbed 85 units and stopped by 17 s; 0x00178A67 went
  643 units at 140–190 units a second towards 308–332° and stopped at 5 s; 0x00178A7F
  and 0x00178A61 moved 800 and 195 units along their paths in starts and stops. They
  spun as they went (their heading turned ±250° a second). The other six stayed put.
- **Then they stayed at rest.** No tumbleweed at rest started again in the next minute,
  in the dust storm or in the calm weather. Only 0x00178A64, stopped on its slope, kept
  rocking back and forth: 1,181 units of path for 84 net in the storm, 461 for 41 in the
  calm.
- **Far off** 0x00178A76 never moved (its cell was not loaded).

So [hypothesis]: the wind pushes a tumbleweed that is awake, along one direction
(north-north-west here, about 330°), and does not wake one that sleeps; a tumbleweed is
awake when its cell loads, rolls until a slope or an obstacle stops it, and then sleeps.
How fast it goes with the wind's speed is not shown (the storm found them asleep); the
direction may be a fixed world wind or the weather's (WTHR DATA stores no direction
[observed: the record's other DATA bytes are 45, 45 or 0, 0 in every weather]).

## 3. What NVForever does

- A body whose collision object has the wind flag and is dynamic is put in the world
  awake, even with the clutter that starts asleep (physics.md §4.3.1).
- Each frame outdoors, for its first 3 s awake (`tumble::GUST`) such a body has its
  horizontal velocity drawn towards the wind's by at most 300 units a second squared
  (`tumble::WIND_ACCEL`, about the pull of gravity on a 25° slope); after that it is
  slowed by 50 units a second squared (`tumble::SETTLE`) until it rests and sleeps; a
  body asleep is left so, and one woken again (a shot, a push) has a new gust
  [hypothesis fitted to §2: a 200 units a second roller goes about 1,000 units, as the
  farthest one did]. Without the end of the gust, the first build's tumbleweeds rolled
  3,500–6,700 units in 30 s on Goodsprings' ground (smoke, 2026-11-06): a sphere rolls
  on for ever on rapier's terrain, which has no rolling resistance and none of the
  original's stones and scrub to lodge in.
- The wind: the trees' and grass's direction, now 120° from +x towards +y (330°
  clockwise from north, §2; it was 30° [chosen]), at 4 units a second per unit of the
  weather's DATA wind speed, so 200 for the usual 50 (`tumble::SPEED_PER_WIND`)
  [hypothesis: the fastest tumbleweeds under 50; linear in the speed is a guess], faded
  across a weather change (`tree::wind_vector`); none indoors and with a still weather.
- The bodies are those in the loaded physics cells (3 × 3 around the player), so the cost
  stays bounded; the exit line `wind summary` gives how many responded, the most blown in
  a frame, the farthest one went and the most time a frame's blowing took.

## 4. Open

- Speed against the weather's wind speed (rerun with the storm forced before the load).
- Whether a tumbleweed ever starts again without a load (a longer watch, an hour of game
  time), and whether the wind or the impulse of a nearby actor wakes it.
- Caesar's throne carries the flag; its bodies are not dynamic, so nothing blows it.
- The tumbleweed pile effect (`effects\tumbleweedpile.nif`) is not placed in the masters.

## 5. Checks

- `cargo test -p fnv-phys the_wind_blows` (a flagged ball placed asleep starts awake and
  rolls downwind at about the wind's speed; an unflagged one is not blown).
- Smoke `wind-tumbleweeds`: Goodsprings at noon; the `wind summary` line has the
  tumbleweeds and one of them going far towards the north-west.
