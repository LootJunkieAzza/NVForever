# Spec note: fast travel from the Pip-Boy's world map

Tags as in `nif.md`: `[documented]` cites a page or file, `[observed]` says what was
looked at, `[hypothesis]` is a reading that nothing has confirmed yet. `[design]` marks
what is NVForever's own. Implementation: `engine/nvf-play/src/pipboy/data/travel.rs`
(the rules, the box's model, the trip) and `pipboy/data.rs` (the click on the map and
the box drawn over it). The Pip-Boy itself: `pipboy.md` §5.3.

## 1. Sources

- **The owner's screenshot** (2026-10-17, kept privately) of the original's World Map
  in Freeside with the question box up: a black box with a thin border in the middle of
  the Pip-Boy's screen, "Do you want to travel to Goodsprings?" centred at its top,
  "Yes" in a bordered box above "No", both centred.
- **The GECK wiki** (the owner's export, `functions.xml`, `Misc.xml`): the pages
  EnableFastTravel, GetPCCanFastTravel, GetMapMarkerTravel, SetOnFastTravelEventHandler,
  the Reference page's "Map Marker" section, and the list of game settings.
- **xEdit's record definitions** as `schemas/fnv/world.json` records them: CELL `DATA`,
  WRLD `DATA`, REFR `FNAM` flags.
- **The game's interface files** in `Fallout - Misc.bsa`: `menus\message_menu.xml` and
  `menus\main\map_menu.xml`. Described in plain words; nothing of them is shipped.
- **The plugins** (FalloutNV.esm and the DLC masters), read with `fnvtool` and a
  throw-away reader of the records' flags (kept privately).

## 2. When the player may travel

**Which markers** [documented: GECK wiki, Reference, Map Marker]: a map marker's "Can
Travel To" flag (`FNAM` bit 1 [documented: xEdit]) lets the player travel there at once;
without it the player "must discover it before fast travel is allowed". ShowMap's
canTravel and ShowAllMapMarkers' canTravel make markers travel targets too [documented:
GECK wiki ShowMap, ShowAllMapMarkers; `fnv_game::functions::player`]. The interface
file keeps a flag per marker, "True if this marker can be used for fast-traveling"
[documented: map_menu.xml, `MapMarkerTemplate` `user0`]. A click on a known marker that
is not a travel target is answered with the setting `sNoFastTravelUndiscovered`
[hypothesis: by its name].

**From where.** The game settings name the refusals [documented: GECK wiki, game
settings list]: `sNoFastTravelScriptBlock`, `sNoFastTravelCell`, `sNoFastTravelInAir`,
`sNoFastTravelCombat`, `sNoFastTravelHostileActorsNear`, `sNoFastTravelOverencumbered`,
`sNoFastTravelAlarm`, `sNoFastTravelUndiscovered`, and `sFastTravelNoTravelHealthDamage`.
Only `sNoFastTravelScriptBlock` has a record in FalloutNV.esm ("Fast travel is currently
unavailable from this location.") [observed]; the others' texts live in the program and
are not read (its code section is encrypted). NVForever uses a plugin's text when one
sets it and its own wording otherwise [design]. What each one means, and the order they
are tried in, are NVForever's reading [hypothesis unless marked]:

1. **A script forbade it**: `EnableFastTravel 0` until `EnableFastTravel 1`, or until
   the player goes from an interior out to an exterior, unless its keep flag was set
   [documented: GECK wiki EnableFastTravel; `fnv_game` keeps the flags]. Text
   `sNoFastTravelScriptBlock`.
2. **The place forbids it**: the worldspace's `DATA` flag "Can't Fast Travel" (bit 1) or
   the cell's `DATA` flag "Can't Travel From Here" (bit 2) [documented: xEdit flag
   names]. Text `sNoFastTravelCell`. In FalloutNV.esm the worldspace flag is set on
   GamorrahWorld, TheFortWorld and Lucky38World; Dead Money sets it on its eight
   Sierra Madre worldspaces; no cell of the base game or of the four story DLCs sets the
   cell flag [observed]. The cell flag is read on the interior the player is in, the
   worldspace flag outdoors [hypothesis].
   - The EnableFastTravel page says the player cannot travel "inside an interior cell"
     [documented]. NVForever lets the player travel from interiors that do not carry the
     cell flag [hypothesis: the flag would be pointless if every interior forbade it,
     and the original lets the player travel out of buildings; to be checked in game].
3. **In the air**: the player's collision body is not on the ground (falling,
   jumping). Text `sNoFastTravelInAir`.
4. **In combat**: a hostile actor near has detected the player — the music's battle
   test (`crate::music`, `MusicCues::combat`) [hypothesis: the player's own combat state
   is not modelled apart from it]. Text `sNoFastTravelCombat`.
5. **Enemies near**: a living hostile actor (`fnv_game::rest::hostile_to_player`)
   within `fHostileActorExteriorDistance` / `fHostileActorInteriorDistance` — the Wait
   menu's test and its distances (wait-menu.md §9) [hypothesis: the same settings serve
   both]. Text `sNoFastTravelHostileActorsNear`.
6. **Over-encumbered** [documented: GECK wiki EnableFastTravel, "if they are
   over-encumbered … they will still be not permitted to fast travel"]: the carried
   weight over the limit, outside god mode (as `crate::player::encumbered_walks`). Text
   `sNoFastTravelOverencumbered`. A perk with the entry point "Has Fast Travel Always"
   lifts this ("Access Fast Travel even when overencumbered", its perk LongHaul
   [documented: GECK wiki perk entry points]); Long Haul's description says the same
   [observed: PERK 0x00146098 `DESC`]. The entry point's code is 51 [observed: Long
   Haul's entry `DATA` 0x33, function Set Value, value 1]; the player has it when the
   perk entries of point 51 set a value other than 0 (`fnv_game::Game::entry_point`).

Not built: the alarm refusal (`sNoFastTravelAlarm`: no alarm state is modelled), the
health refusal (`sFastTravelNoTravelHealthDamage`: what it checks is not known), and the scripted checks of the script extenders (GetPCCanFastTravel).

## 3. The question box

The interface file of the message box says it draws "on top of the Pipboy"
[documented: message_menu.xml, a comment on its list's clipping], so the question is a
message box over the Pip-Boy's screen. On the screenshot it stands in the middle of the
screen, a black box with a thin line all round, the question centred at the top and
the two answers centred under it, the chosen one ("Yes") in a box [observed]. The text
is the setting `sTravelQuestion` [documented: the settings list; the text is not in the
plugins], which reads "Do you want to travel to Goodsprings?" for Goodsprings
[observed: screenshot]; the answers "Yes" and "No" [observed].

NVForever [design unless marked]: the box is drawn into the DATA page over the map, in
the Pip-Boy's amber, by the screenshot's look: 520 wide, centred on the map window,
the text in font 2 and the answers under it, the chosen one framed as the message box
frames its button (`message-menu.md` §2: the line at brightness 200, the fill at 40
opacity). It opens on Yes [observed: the screenshot]. Up and Down (W and S) move the
choice, Enter, Space or E take it, Y and N answer directly; the pointer chooses the
answer it is on and a click takes it. While it is up the map does not pan or follow the
pointer. The question is the only box: a refusal is a top-left corner message with the
refusal's text, as the Wait menu's refusals are (`corner-messages.md`), and the map stays
as it was [owner request 2026-10-17].

## 4. The trip

**The destination** [documented: GECK wiki SetOnFastTravelEventHandler: the reference
the player is sent to "may or may not be an actual Map Marker", the real marker being
linked to it]: a map marker's linked reference (`XLKR`) is where the player arrives.
182 of the 189 named map markers in FalloutNV.esm have one [observed]; Goodsprings'
marker 0x000CDF51 links 0x001658B7, an `XMarkerHeading` named
`GoodspringsArrivalMarker` [observed]. Without one the player arrives at the marker
itself [hypothesis]. The player is put on the ground by the arrival rule every travel
uses (`crate::phys`, simulation.md §7), facing the destination's heading.

**The loading.** The trip goes as every door's does: the Pip-Boy is put away and a
`TravelRequest` brings the loading screen up (`crate::loading`) [design: the same
path for doors, scripts and the console].

**The clock** [hypothesis: no source read gives the original's rule]: the game time the
player would take to walk the straight line from where they stand to the destination at
the observed walking speed (`MoveSpeeds::OBSERVED.walk`, 86.8 units a second) at the
game's TimeScale (30 when the plugins lack it): hours = distance / 86.8 × TimeScale /
3600. Goodsprings' marker to Primm's (about 57,000 units) is about 5.5 hours, to
Novac's (about 100,000) about 9.6 [observed: the markers' places]. The hours
pass for the player's effects and needs (`fnv_game::Game::pass_hours`) and, a whole
hour at a time, for the people (`wait::HourPassed`, as after a wait) [design]. A trip
within one cell's width (4096 units) passes no time [design].

**Followers** [documented: GECK wiki, "Changing cells will teleport the teammate to the
player"]: the teammates following the player come along, put beside them
(`fnv_game::Game::bring_teammates`, as through a load door).

## 5. Checking it

Pip-Boy test aid steps (`NVF_PLAY_TEST_PIPBOY`): `travel=<marker FormID>` does what a
click on that marker of the World Map does; `key=use` takes the chosen answer, `key=down`
moves to No. The log says "fast travel: …" for the question, the refusal (with its
reason) and the trip ("fast travel: to … at …, N.NN hours on the clock"). Smoke
scenarios `fast-travel-*` in `tools/smoke/scenarios.toml`.

## 6. Open

The original's travel-time rule and its settings; whether the original refuses from
interiors; the box's exact size and fonts (the screenshot is the only picture); the
refusals' texts; random encounters on the way (none in New Vegas that we know of).
