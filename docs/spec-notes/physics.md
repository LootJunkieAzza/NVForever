# Spec notes: physics and the character controller (Layer 4, workstream 2)

Clean-room description in plain language. Tags: **[documented]** cites a public source,
**[observed]** was measured on the owner's install (FNV 1.4.0.525, the ten masters) or in
this repository's tests, **[hypothesis]** needs verification. Design and workstream split:
docs/design/layer4.md §2.8 and §7. Code: `crates/fnv-phys`, `crates/fnvtool/src/phys_cmd.rs`.

Status 2026-10-07: the world (terrain, reference bodies, characters), queries, the
character controller, dynamic bodies and fixed-step stepping are implemented and tested on
synthetic data; terrain is built from the real LAND data of every worldspace. Placed
references get their mesh collision through workstream 1's converter
(`fnv_collide::nif::collision_objects`, merged from `claude/layer4-collide`) and
CollisionMarker references their placed box or sphere (§4.1); `fnvtool phys cell` builds
both from the owner's install (§7).

## 1. Engine choice

`rapier3d` 0.36 with the `enhanced-determinism` feature (owner decision, layer4.md §2.8;
dependencies.md). That feature forces libm-based maths in its maths dependencies
(`simba/libm_force`, `parry3d/enhanced-determinism`) [documented: rapier3d 0.36
Cargo.toml]. Pure Rust, Apache-2.0, no Bevy coupling. rapier 0.36 uses `glam` vectors
(through `glamx`); `fnv-phys` exposes only plain `[f32; 3]` and row-major `[f32; 9]`
values so the Bevy engine (`engine/`) is free to use its own `glam` version.

## 2. Conventions

- **Units and axes**: the public API uses game units, Z up, rotations as row-major 3×3
  matrices rotating column vectors, like `fnv_collide::shape` and `fnv_world::transform`.
- **Internal scale**: rapier runs in metres. Several of its tolerances are absolute and
  sized for metres; the character controller, for example, counts a contact as ground
  only within `offset + 0.05` of the capsule [documented: rapier3d 0.36
  `control/character_controller.rs`, `predict_ground`], which is under one game unit.
  Run in game units, a character walking across flat terrain lost ground contact at cell
  seams [observed: tests]. Every length is divided by `PhysParams::units_per_metre` on
  the way in and multiplied on the way out. The factor is a numerical choice
  (default 70 [hypothesis: the commonly quoted size of a game unit, ~1.43 cm]); results in
  game units should not depend on it beyond rounding.
- **Placing a reference's collision**: a collision object's body sits at
  `reference ∘ node_transform ∘ body_transform`, where the reference transform is
  translation = position, rotation = `fnv_world::transform::ref_rotation` (world.md §4) and
  a uniform scale = XSCL. Scale is baked into the shapes (dimensions and child offsets) and
  into the node/body translations, because rigid bodies cannot scale. A reference's
  transform **replaces** its model's root transform (world.md §4) [observed for rendering];
  `fnv-phys` therefore assumes `CollisionObject::node_transform` is relative to the root
  *without* the root's own transform [hypothesis: to be confirmed with workstream 1, §8].
- **Shape trees**: rapier forbids composite shapes inside composites, so a
  `Shape::Compound` tree is flattened; each leaf (box, sphere, capsule, convex hull,
  triangle mesh) becomes one collider on the object's body with the leaf's composed pose.
  Leaves that fail (non-positive or non-finite size, degenerate hull, triangle index out
  of range, rotation not orthonormal within 1e-3 or with a reflection) are returned as
  errors and the rest of the body is kept; nothing is dropped silently.

## 3. Terrain

One collider per exterior cell from the LAND heights (`fnv_world::land`, world.md §3):
the 33 × 33 vertices 128 units apart from the cell's south-west corner. Each grid square
is split into two triangles along its **south-west → north-east diagonal**, the same split
the renderer uses (`engine/nvforever/src/terrain.rs`) [hypothesis: the original's split
is unknown; to be checked by standing a probe on a steep square in-game, §6].
`fnv_phys::terrain::height_at` states that surface analytically.

- **Triangle mesh, not rapier's heightfield.** rapier 0.36's heightfield missed vertical
  rays that run exactly along some interior grid lines: on 9 of the 31 interior
  north–south lines (lines 17–20, 22, 24, 25, 28 and 29 counted from the west edge) every
  one of 50 rays missed, on flat and bumpy fields and at two cell positions alike
  [observed: test program in this workstream]. Ground probes at whole
  multiples of 128 are common, so terrain is a triangle mesh with internal-edge fixing
  (`TriMeshFlags::FIX_INTERNAL_EDGES`).
  A different heightfield set-up did not miss [observed, branch `claude/layer4-phys-alt`]:
  heights passed with rows along world x (parry row `i`, column `j` = LAND row `j`,
  column `i`), the collider rotated so parry's x → world y, y → world z, z → world x, every
  cell set to parry's zig-zag split (south-west → north-east in that frame), in game units
  rather than metres: vertical rays at all 33 × 33 vertices of every cell of WastelandNV,
  BigMT, Zion and Freeside (about 27 million rays, all on grid lines) hit, with the
  answering cell's height equal to LAND exactly. The misses above may come from the axis
  mapping or the metre scaling; a heightfield needs less memory than a mesh, should that
  matter for streaming.
- **Check on the data** (`fnvtool phys terrain`, §7): for every landscape cell of every
  worldspace of the ten masters, 126 vertical rays per cell (64 scattered points, the 31
  interior vertices on the cell's diagonal and 31 points on grid lines) against
  `height_at`: 30 worldspaces, 41,983 cells, 5,289,858 rays, **0 misses, 0 rays hitting
  another collider**, largest error 0.19 units (WastelandNV cell (25, −59), about 240,000
  units from the origin, where f32 spacing is about 0.016 units) [observed].
- 484 LAND records carry no heights (no VHGT), e.g. WastelandNV (23, −65) and (24, −65),
  whose LAND holds only DATA flags and vertex colours [observed]; those cells get no
  terrain collision. What the original does there is unknown [hypothesis: they lie
  outside the playable area].

## 4. Bodies from collision objects

| Collision object | Body | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| `Motion::Static` | fixed | [hypothesis] |
| `Motion::Keyframed` | kinematic, position-driven | [hypothesis] |
| `Motion::Dynamic` | dynamic; collider densities scaled so the body mass equals `mass` (volume-derived mass kept when `mass` ≤ 0) | [hypothesis] |

Friction and restitution are passed to rapier unchanged [hypothesis: Havok's coefficients
and combine rules may differ from rapier's averaging]. Triangle-mesh colliders keep their
per-triangle Havok material code, returned by ray hits (footstep sounds, impact effects
later).

**Collision layers.** Every reference collider keeps its Havok layer
(`Owner::Ref::layer`). The layer numbers 0–42 and their names (0 Unidentified, 1 Static,
2 AnimStatic, 3 Transparent, 4 Clutter, ... 12 Trigger, 13 Terrain, 15 Non Collidable,
27 Invisible Wall, 30 Char Controller, 32 Collision Box, ... 42 Dropping Pick) are those of
the REFR XTRI field [documented: xEdit wbDefinitionsFNV.pas, re-expressed in
`schemas/fnv/world.json`; `fnv_phys::layers` checks its table against the schema]. That
mesh collision objects use the same numbering is [hypothesis] (collision.md §4). The
original's layer matrix (which layers collide with which) is unknown. Queries take
`Filter::exclude_layers`; the character controller ignores, by default, the layers whose
names describe volumes or picks rather than obstacles: Water, Trigger, Non Collidable,
Portal, Acoustic Space, Actor Zone, Projectile Zone, Cloud/Gas Trap, Avoid Box, Camera
Sphere, Door Detection, the pick layers, Spell Explosion, Debris Small and Shell Casing
(`layers::character_ignores`) [hypothesis: chosen from the names; capture question §6].

`fnvtool phys cell` skips deleted references, initially disabled ones and ones disabled
through their enable parent (the renderer's rule, `engine/nvforever/src/world.rs`):
disabled references are not drawn and have no collision [observed by the owner in game, 2026-10-08]. The
enable state at run time belongs to `fnv-sim`, which will add and remove bodies as
references change state. Models come from
the game's archives and loose files (`fnv_vfs`, default archive order) and are converted
once per model; SpeedTree models (`.spt`, trees) hold no Havok blocks and get no collision
[observed: they are not NIF files; whether trees block the player in-game is a capture
question, §6].

On the owner's install, Goodsprings with the cells around it (radius 1): 1,136 placed
references; 839 get collision (1,369 colliders from 167 of the 194 distinct models, none
unreadable), 211 use a model without collision objects, 43 are trees, 25 have no model, 8
are initially disabled, 10 are disabled through their enable parent, 8 CollisionMarker
primitives [observed: `fnvtool phys cell --cell Goodsprings`, 2026-10-08; before the
enable-parent rule the 10 were included, 849 references and 1,430 colliders]. 64 probe
characters dropped on an 8 × 8 grid over the cell all come to rest, 21 of them on
references (rocks, buildings), the others on terrain [observed, before the enable-parent
rule].

### 4.1 Placed collision primitives (CollisionMarker)

Some references carry their own shape instead of a model: REFR XPRM holds bounds (three
floats), a colour and a type (1 box, 2 sphere, 3 "portal box"), and XTRI a collision
layer [documented: xEdit wbDefinitionsFNV.pas REFR]. In the ten masters [observed:
census of the winning REFR records]:

| Base object | XPRM type | References |
|---|---|---|
| STAT 0x00000021 "CollisionMarker" | 3 | 2,901 |
| STAT 0x00000021 "CollisionMarker" | 1 (box) | 1,155 |
| STAT 0x00000021 "CollisionMarker" | 2 (sphere) | 149 |
| 0x00000020 (no record; portal) | 3 | 1,228 |
| STAT 0x0000001F "RoomMarker" | 1 | 1,044 |
| 0x00000017 (no record; occlusion plane) | 3 | 264 |
| ACTI trigger activators (e.g. `NVDLC01ToxicCloudTrigger`) | 1 | ~1,000 |

8,819 references have XPRM; only 3 have XTRI. So primitives cannot be selected by layer:
`fnv-phys` turns the primitives of **CollisionMarker** references into static colliders
(types 1 and 3 as boxes, type 2 as a sphere) [hypothesis: CollisionMarkers are the invisible
walls; the name suggests it], and leaves portals, rooms, occlusion planes and trigger
activators out (they are culling volumes and script triggers by their bases [hypothesis];
triggers will become sensors when scripts need them, Layer 5). A primitive without XTRI
gets layer 0.

**Bounds are read as half extents** (sphere: the first value is the radius). Evidence
[observed]: for the 3,007 exterior CollisionMarker boxes without x/y rotation, the box
bottom against the terrain under the reference: read as half extents, 24.4% of the boxes
float above the ground (median bottom 115 units *below* it); read as full extents, 76.9%
float (median bottom 160 units *above* it), which would leave walls the player could walk
under. Still a [hypothesis] until checked in game (§6). Reproduce:
`cargo run --release -p fnv-phys --example primitive_bounds -- <Data> schemas/fnv`.

### 4.2 Collision layer matrix (B11): design and predictions

Which collision layers stop the player is unknown (§4); `layers::character_ignores` is a
choice from the names. In and around Goodsprings the references with collision use the
layers Unidentified (0, CollisionMarker primitives), Static, AnimStatic (keyframed doors,
containers), Clutter and Props (dynamic), Biped (the ragdoll bodies of placed actors'
skeletons), Trees (Havok trees), Terrain (rocks), Non Collidable (plants, static and
dynamic) and Transparent Small (yuccas, chain-link fences) [observed: `fnvtool phys cell
--cell Goodsprings --list-refs`]. Note: placed NPCs and creatures get the bodies of their
skeleton models as keyframed obstacles on the Biped layer (173 objects here); in game
actors have their own character controller [hypothesis], so those bodies probably should
not stop the player; not tested by B11 (actors move).

Test (`parity-lab/inputs/layer4/b11_goodsprings.drops.json`, scenario
`L4.phys.drops.b11_goodsprings`, job `mv_b11_drops`): the player is put 200 units above
the top a vertical ray finds at a reference's position (300 above a SpeedTree's base) and
falls; its final feet are compared with `fnvtool phys cell --drops-file` (tolerance 8,
because `SetPos` drops in game rested 0–7.5 above the contact shell, §6.2). Predictions of
the candidate, written 2026-10-08 before any capture of this job (character ignores the
§4 list; dynamic Props start at rest):

So the candidate predicts: every layer stops the player except Non Collidable (agave,
maize) and the SpeedTree shrub (no collision in our world); dynamic Props hold the
player at least while it lands. A difference of more than 16 units on any row changes
the matrix. The clutter row (job `mv_b11_clutter`: a whiskey bottle, Clutter layer,
placed with `PlaceAtMe` and moved 200 units above eleven of these targets) has no
candidate yet: dynamic bodies collide with every layer in `fnv-phys` today.

**Results** (capture `mv_b11_drops`, run by the coordinator 2026-10-08 on the re-made
`nvfdoc`; golden `phys/b11_goodsprings.drops.json`) [observed]. The first comparison
passed 12 of 20 rows; what the differences showed:

| Row | Game feet z | Candidate before → now | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| collision_marker_a | 8484.33 | 8373.50 → 8484.74 | the player rested on the Goodsprings school (SCOL 0x00177C9E, placed in the next cell south), which the probe's world lacked: `phys cell` now loads the cells around each probe's own square too [hypothesis: the game loads cells around the player wherever it is] |
| animstatic_gate | 8691.58 (on the terrain, x/y unchanged) | 8770.10 → 8691.51 | the gate 0x0010757E carries ONAM "Open by Default" [documented: xEdit]: its panel is open in game. The keyframed parts of open-by-default doors are left out (their open pose comes from the door's animation, not read) |
| collision_marker_b | 8285.81 (fell through, x/y moved 0.1) | 8571.53 (unchanged) | a Portal Box marker whose box is 2 units thick: dropped onto its top the player fell through it; but a run into another Portal Box marker stopped 22 units from its plane (`L4.phys.walk.portal_wall`, §6.4), so Portal Box markers stay solid. Open: why the drop passed |
| havok_tree_a / _b | 8637.98 / 8879.92 | 8582.72 / 8813.61 → 8624.07 / 8869.53 (§6.4.1) | still open, 13.9 and 10.4 low. The game's player rests 55 and 66 higher in the branches of `treewastelandhardwood01.nif`; a capsule of radius 21 or 24 does not explain it (8590, 8598); a dropped bottle came to rest at 8564.07 on tree a, near our top at the centre (8556.5), so the geometry is probably right and the player's shape against branches differs [hypothesis]. Diagnostic grid `mv_diag_trees_rocks` below |
| terrain_rock_a / _b | 8333.09 / 8506.51 | 8323.63 / 8515.13 | rock b: the game's own spread (six drops over 7.8 units); rock a: the candidate lands on a step's edge and slides down it, open (follow-up below) |
| noncollidable_maize | z 8705.24, x/y moved 14 | x/y unchanged | a landing slide downhill on the 5° LAND that the game makes in about one landing in four or five; not the maize (follow-up below) |
| props_barrel | not observed | — | the player did not fall: it hung at 8615.39, 9 units sideways (golden row without feet) |

Now 15 of 20 rows agree (14 since Portal Box markers became solid again, §6.4, which
brought back the `collision_marker_b` difference). **The player row of the matrix** [observed]: Static, AnimStatic
(the mailbox, a closed gate part), Trees (Havok), Terrain (rocks), Transparent Small
(chain-link fence end, yucca), Props (a crate, at least while landing) and CollisionMarker
boxes stop the player; Non Collidable plants (static and dynamic) and SpeedTree shrubs do
not. `layers::character_ignores` already agrees on every layer tested; nothing changed.
Not tested: Water, Trigger, Invisible Wall, Collision Box, Debris, Biped (placed actors'
skeleton bodies, §4.2 note).

**Rock and maize follow-up: facts and predictions** (written 2026-10-08 before the captures
`mv_diag_maize` and `mv_diag_rocks`, `tools/capture/jobs/make_b11_followup_jobs.py`; drops
in `diag_maize.drops.json` and `diag_rocks.drops.json`; each drop is traced every game
loop from the moment the player starts to fall, followed by a scan for actors within 600
units).

Facts gathered for the maize row [observed: `fnvtool phys cell --list-refs`, `fnvtool
world refs`, `fnvtool collide objects`, `fnvtool nif decode`, rays]:

- The game's player ended at (−74583.1, 1406.89): moved (+9.90, −9.91), exactly along a
  diagonal. The LAND there is one plane over squares (25, 10)–(26, 12) of cell (−19, 0),
  sloped 5.05° with its downhill direction (+0.062, −0.062): **the push points straight
  downhill**. The rest height at the new point is 3.87 above LAND, the usual terrain band
  (§6.2).
- But the B11 `noncollidable_agave_pickable` drop landed on LAND of the same 5.05°
  slope (downhill (−0.062, −0.062)), from 218 units instead of 284, and did not move;
  the `speedtree_shrub` drop (3.6° slope, 285 units) did not move; `collision_marker_b`
  fell through onto an 18.6° slope and moved 0.15. So a slope alone does not make the
  player slide after a `SetPos` drop.
- `maize_healthy01.nif`'s only collision is a box of 12 triangles (packed strips under a
  MOPP), 7 × 9 × 87 units, layer 15 (Non Collidable) on the body and on its one sub-shape
  [documented: sub-shape filter field, nif.xml `hkSubPartData`]; its top is flat at
  z 8789.2 and covers the drop point (rays every 2 units). The agaves are layer 15 convex
  hulls (33 × 30 × 16) that the player fell straight through. Were the maize box solid to
  the player, a drop on its axis would rest on its flat top (8789.9), not on the ground.
- Placed references within 300 units (any type, also without collision in our world):
  only plants: `MaizeWitheredGroup1` 0x0017747D (STAT, 67 units north, no collision
  object in its mesh), six agaves, three honey mesquites and one agave pickable (130–300
  units away). No markers, SpeedTree shrubs or actors are placed there; actors can walk
  by (Goodsprings has wandering NPCs and creatures).

Hypotheses and what each predicts for `mv_diag_maize` [hypothesis]:

- **H-actor** (something moving, e.g. an actor, pushed the player): the push does not
  repeat at the same place; when it happens an actor is within reach (actor scan).
- **H-slide** (a landing slide on the slope whose occurrence depends on the landing): the
  trace shows the sideways motion starting at touchdown (feet ≈ 8706) and running downhill
  (+x, −y); it also happens on the bare slope 49 units away (`slope_bare_*`) and with the
  maize disabled; larger from higher drops.
- **H-stalk** (the maize box acts on the player after all): sideways motion starts near
  the box top (feet ≈ 8790) or, for the drop started below the top (`maize_inside`), at
  once; drops ±30 from the axis and drops with the maize disabled fall straight.
- The candidate (Non Collidable ignored, no landing slide) predicts every drop straight
  down: maize_c1–c3, maize_high, maize_low, maize_inside, maize_disabled_1/2 at
  (−74593.0, 1416.5, 8706.19); maize_+30x 8704.31; maize_−30x 8708.06; maize_+30y
  8708.05; maize_−30y 8704.31; slope_bare 8701.82; agave_pickable 8529.83.

For the rocks: the candidate's centre drops end at rock a (−69874.3, 714.7, 8323.62),
having slid (+3.3, −3.9) on a 10.6° face to a capsule rest 0.6 above the surface, where
the game's B11 drop stayed at the drop point 9.5 higher; on rock b (−69656.2, 1619.8,
8515.13), 29 units above the surface under the axis (the capsule's side rests on a higher
part of the rock), where the game's two drops gave 8506.51 and 8512.78. Open ground
8355.51 (game 8355.85). Rock a grid (candidate z): −30/−30 8340.90, −30/+0 8347.03,
−30/+30 8348.76, +0/−30 8336.33, +0/+30 8353.62, +30/−30 8328.27, +30/+0 8318.60,
+30/+30 8318.43. **H-spread**: the four repeats on each rock scatter over several units
(rock b already 6.3) and the candidate lies inside or near that scatter; **H-systematic**:
repeats agree within about 1 unit and stay 9.5 above (rock a) / 8.6 below (rock b) the
candidate; on rock a a systematic difference would come with the game not sliding where
the candidate slides (the grid shows where the rock's surface rises within the capsule's
radius). Every drop's trace is checked for the `SetPos` hang (resting 7–11 above the
support, §6.2).

**Results of the follow-up** (captures `mv_diag_maize`, `mv_diag_rocks`, run unattended by
this workstream 2026-10-08 on `nvfdoc`, 0 failed steps) [observed]. Two drops are left out:
`maize_disabled_1` stopped in mid-air 100 units above the ground three loops into its fall
and stayed there while the clock ran (the `SetPos` hang, §6.2), and `agave_pickable_2`
stopped 39 units up with the game clock frozen too (the world standing still after a
`SetPos`, §6.3). No actor was within 600 units at any drop (the nearest 1,743–2,128 units
away).

Maize (13 usable drops on the same 5.05° LAND plane, plus the B11 drop):

| Drop | Game feet (x, y, z) | Moved (x, y) | Touchdown loop |
|---|---|---|---|
| maize_c1 | (−74593.0, 1416.8, 8706.48) | 0 | 32 ms, 8.65 above rest |
| maize_c2 | (−74593.1, 1416.78, 8706.48) | (−0.10, −0.02) | 31 ms, 11.81 |
| maize_c3 | (−74580.9, 1403.66, 8704.90) | **(+12.10, −13.14)** | 31 ms, 4.14 |
| maize_high | (−74591.5, 1414.97, 8706.27) | (+1.50, −1.83) | landed in a 31-ms loop, moved in the next (63 ms) |
| maize_low | (−74593.0, 1416.8, 8706.48) | 0 | 31 ms, 5.39 |
| maize_inside | (−74593.0, 1416.8, 8709.53) | 0 | 15 ms, 3.71 (ended 3 above the band) |
| maize_+30x | (−74552.0, 1404.7, 8703.16) | **(+11.00, −12.10)** | 31 ms, 5.49 |
| maize_−30x / +30y / −30y | 8708.35 / 8708.35 / 8704.60 | 0 | 31–47 ms |
| slope_bare_1 / _2 | (−74560.0, 1380.0, 8702.12) both | 0 | 31 ms / 62 ms |

- **The push is a landing slide, not the maize**: it came in 3 of 14 drops on that plane
  (B11, c3, +30x) and a small one in `maize_high`; always downhill (+x, −y), within
  3° of the slope's direction (the small one 6°); always in the single loop of touchdown (c3: 4.0 down and 16.4 sideways in
  one loop, then 1.7 more in the next and nothing after; +30x likewise), so the vertical
  drop plus the sideways move of that loop add up to about the 19 units the fall speed
  would have carried the player in it. It happened 30 units from the maize's axis
  (`maize_+30x`, the capsule clear of the 7 × 9 box), so **H-stalk is refuted**; the
  repeats at the B11 point slid once in three, so whether it happens is the game's own
  spread, and **H-actor is refuted** (no actor near). A long touchdown loop (31 ms and
  more) came with every slide but also with seven straight landings; what decides it is
  not known. One valid drop with the maize disabled fell straight, which says nothing
  given the rate.
- So the B11 row's golden (moved 14) shows a slide that the game makes in roughly one
  landing in four or five here; the candidate falls straight, as the game did in 10 of 14
  drops. Nothing in the candidate changed [not modelled: a random landing slide; a model
  would need the rule that triggers it].

Rocks (repeats at the B11 drop points, interleaved; x/y unchanged unless noted):

| Target | Game feet z (drops) | Range | Mean | Candidate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rock a 0x001075A0 | B11 8333.09; 8333.45, 8329.03 (moved 1.16), 8336.16, 8327.10 (moved 3.46) | 9.06 | 8331.77 | 8323.62 (slid 5.1) |
| rock b 0x00107587 | B11 8506.51 (moved 2.8); `mv_diag_trees_rocks` 8512.78; 8512.59, 8514.35, 8510.37, 8512.63 | 7.84 | 8511.54 | 8515.13 |
| open ground (control) | B11 8355.85; 8355.85 four times | 0 | 8355.85 | 8355.51 |

Rock a grid (game / candidate z; the game moved 0 at every point): −30/−30 8339.97 /
8340.90; −30/+0 8344.17 / 8347.03; −30/+30 8349.07 / 8348.76; +0/−30 8334.76 / 8336.33;
+0/+30 8353.51 / 8353.62; +30/−30 8326.12 / 8328.27; +30/+0 8318.65 / 8318.60; +30/+30
8324.53 / 8318.43 (the candidate slid 6.3 there). 7 of 8 within 3 units.

- **Geometry, Havok scale and shells are right on both rocks**: the grids agree within 3
  (rock a, 7 of 8) and 4 (rock b, 7 of 9) units; flat ground repeats to 0.01 and the
  candidate is 0.34 under it (the band of §6.2); the differences below are 3–20 units,
  far more than any shell (0.7 on the rock, 3.5 on terrain).
- **Rock b is within the game's spread**: four drops at the same x/y rested at four
  heights over 4 units, six drops over 7.8; the candidate is 0.8 above the highest, 3.6
  above the mean, and the B11 golden is the lowest of the six (the one drop that moved).
  On flat ground identical drops agree to 0.01, so the spread comes with resting on the
  rock's uneven surface [observed], not with the drops themselves.
- **Rock a is partly systematic**: the candidate is 3.5 below the lowest of five game drops
  and 8.2 below their mean. Cause [observed: `fnvtool phys walk` trace of the same drop]:
  27 units above the surface under the axis a near-vertical step (face normals with
  z 0.11–0.19) runs about 12.7 units from the drop axis; the candidate's capsule
  (radius 18) touches the step's top edge at 8343.15, is flagged sliding, and creeps down
  the face at about 11 units/s for 1.8 s to 8323.63. The game's player comes to rest at
  touchdown somewhere on that face (8327.10–8336.16) and does not move in the next 300
  loops; in drop c1 it passed 8341.34 without being stopped, where the candidate's
  capsule already stands on the edge. Both the higher first contact and the slow slide
  differ. No single change fits [hypothesis, checked with `phys walk` radius overrides]:
  a capsule that stops where it lands would stay at 8343 (10 above the B11 golden), a
  radius of 12 or less misses the edge and lands at 8323.9; the game's rest heights look
  like "stops where the touchdown loop ends, on a face the candidate's shape cannot reach
  that low" [hypothesis]. Same family as the Havok tree rows (the game rests on steep
  branch faces where rapier's controller slides off, §6.4), which the jump-trees
  workstream owns; a shape measurement at a clean vertical edge is designed as backlog
  B13 (layer4-captures.md §3). **Update 2026-10-08 (jump-trees workstream)**: B13 was run
  as `mv_diag_fence_edge` / `_low` (§6.4.1); with the body derived from it (radius 22, cone
  bottom, no slide while falling) the candidate's rock a centre drop rests at 8333.87,
  inside the game's five-drop range 8327.10–8336.16, without sliding off the step edge.
- No change made to the candidate and no tolerance or golden touched. **Question for the
  owner** (scenario design is the owner's): rock b and maize differ from their goldens by
  the game's own spread (rock b 7.8 units over six identical drops; the maize slide in 3
  of 14 landings); with one capture per row and a tolerance of 8, such rows pass or fail
  by which landing the capture caught. Options: (a) keep the rows and their goldens as
  they are (they stay red until the candidate models the spread's cause); (b) build drop
  goldens from repeated drops (e.g. the median of 4–6) with a tolerance set from the
  observed spread; (c) compare only z for drop rows, or move rows on uneven surfaces
  (rocks, slopes) to a separate scenario. Rock a would fail under any of these (the
  candidate is outside the game's range).
- **Owner decision (2026-10-08): option (b), the median of repeated drops.** The B11
  golden is rebuilt from five repeats of every drop, captured in two game sessions
  (`mv_b11_drops_rep_a`, 3 rounds, and `mv_b11_drops_rep_b`, 2 rounds; each round runs
  all 20 drops in order, so the repeats of a drop are minutes apart): per row, the median
  of the repeats that fell, per coordinate (`capture_moves.py golden … --also …`, which
  also records each repeat and the spread). The median also keeps a single `SetPos` hang
  (§6.2) or a single landing slide out of the golden. It goes to a new file,
  `phys/b11_goodsprings.median.drops.json`; the first capture's golden stays as it was.
  The tolerance stays 8 (the owner chose the median; a tolerance from the spread was
  not decided).

  Predictions for the median golden (written before the capture; the candidate is
  unchanged): rock b passes (the game's six earlier drops have median 8512.6, the
  candidate 8515.13); the maize row passes (the game fell straight in 10 of 14 drops;
  median x/y at the drop point, z near 8706.5 against 8706.19); rock a fails (earlier
  median 8333.09 against 8323.62); the Havok tree rows fail (43–303 units at every
  point of the grid, §6.4); the other 13 observed rows still pass. Open bets:
  `collision_marker_b` (the game fell through the 2-unit Portal Box once; if that was
  chance, the median rests on its top, 8571.53 in the candidate, and the row passes) and
  `props_barrel` (no reading yet; the candidate rests on the barrel at 8415.18). So 16 of
  20 rows with the two bets lost, up to 17 of 19 observed if they are won.

  **Results** (captures `mv_b11_drops_rep_a` and `_rep_b`, 2026-10-08, this workstream,
  `nvfdoc`; 7 failed steps, all "never started to fall", kept out of the median)
  [observed]: 16 of 20 rows pass, as predicted; both bets lost. Per row (repeats that fell,
  median z, spread of z):

  | Row | n | Median z | Spread | Candidate | |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | collision_marker_a | 5 | 8484.15 | 2.70 | 8484.74 | pass |
  | collision_marker_b | 5 | 8285.65 | 0.02 | 8571.53 | fail: fell through all five times, so not chance |
  | collision_marker_c, static_fence_rail, static_mailbox | 5 | 8752.04, 8215.44, 8453.86 | 0 | | pass |
  | animstatic_gate | 5 | 8691.85 | 0.26 | 8691.51 | pass |
  | havok_tree_a / _b | 5 / 4 | 8638.39 / 8879.15 | 4.2 / 4.2 | 8582.72 / 8813.61 | fail (jump-trees workstream) |
  | props_crate | 4 | 8423.54 | 2.30 | | pass |
  | props_barrel | 0 | — | — | 8415.18 | the player never started to fall, five times out of five (it hangs at the drop point, 9 units sideways as in the first capture); row without feet |
  | terrain_rock_a | 5 | 8333.27 | 6.61 | 8323.62 | fail (−9.65); four of five within 0.5 of 8333.5 |
  | terrain_rock_b | 5 | 8508.04 | 6.10 | 8515.13 | pass (+7.09) |
  | noncollidable_maize | 5 | 8706.48 | 0 | 8706.19 | pass: fell straight all five times |
  | the other seven rows | 5 | | 0 | | pass |

  **With the jump-trees body** (radius 22 on a cone bottom, a falling body that does not
  slide off steep contacts; §6.4.1) [observed, 2026-10-08]: **17 of 20**. terrain_rock_a
  8333.87 (+0.60, passes), terrain_rock_b 8512.99 (+4.95, passes), noncollidable_maize
  8706.41 (−0.07), havok_tree_a / _b 8624.07 / 8869.53 (−14.32 / −9.61, fail),
  collision_marker_b unchanged (8571.55, fail: the body still stops on the Portal Box),
  props_crate −5.96, the other rows within 2.7; props_barrel still has no game row. The
  diagnostics with this body: `mv_diag_rocks` repeats all within the game's spread (rock a
  +0.42 … +6.77 against four drops spread over 9.1, rock b −1.36 … +2.62), the rock a ±30
  grid within 2.4 at all eight points, the rock b grid within 3 at seven of nine (+4.9 at
  −30/+0); `mv_diag_maize`: the straight drops within 0.1, the game's landing slides
  (3 of 14) and the two hangs not modelled, as before.

  Rock b passes with 0.9 to spare: over eleven game drops now (8506.51–8514.35; median
  8510.37) the candidate stays at the top of the range, so the row stays sensitive to which
  five drops a capture catches; recorded, tolerance left alone. Rows on statics, terrain,
  plants and markers repeat to 0.3 units or exactly; the spread lives on the
  uneven surfaces (rocks, trees) and the dynamic crate. Rebuild:
  `python tools/capture/capture_moves.py golden C:/fnv-private/capture/out/mv_b11_drops_rep_a.<time>.jsonl parity-lab/inputs/layer4/b11_goodsprings.drops.json --also C:/fnv-private/capture/out/mv_b11_drops_rep_b.<time>.jsonl -o C:/fnv-private/goldens/phys/b11_goodsprings.median.drops.json`.

**Clutter row** (`mv_b11_clutter`) [observed]: the bottles bounced or rolled 50–300 units
from the drop point (the control drop on open ground ended 183 units away), so most rows
cannot be read. Two can: on Havok tree a the bottle stayed at (-74300.6, -1170.0, 8564.07)
and on rock a it rested at 8325.87, on the rock; Trees and Terrain stop clutter too.

### 4.3 Dropped items (references created at run time)

`engine/nvf-play` gives an item dropped from the inventory (a reference `fnv-sim` creates,
FormID from 0xFF000000) the collision objects of its base form's model through
`PhysWorld::add_ref`, at the simulation's pose with scale 1, loaded and unloaded with the
physics cell containing it. Dynamic objects fall and settle like placed clutter; while the
body moves, the reference pose `R = R_body R_localᵀ`, `t = t_body − R t_local` (local = the
object's node and body transforms) is written back to the simulation, for models with
exactly one collision object. That a dropped item falls at all is [hypothesis]: a
scripted `player.Drop` stayed at its drop point for 10 s in game [observed]; the
evidence, the readings and the capture that would settle it are in simulation.md §5
"After the drop".

In our engine [observed, `nvforever --play`, 2026-10-08]: a stimpak (one dynamic Clutter
object) dropped 30 units above Doc Mitchell's floor (z 7360) came to rest on its side at
z 7360.97, 29.7 lower and 8.7 units from the drop point, 1.58 s after the menu closed
(its body asleep); dropped just outside the front door (the drop point the game reported
for the same spot within 0.3 units, simulation.md §5) it came to rest on the ground at
8692.71, 30.9 lower. Repeated runs came to rest within 0.1 units of each other (the steps
are fixed, but how many run per frame depends on frame times).

## 5. Determinism and precision

- The world advances only in fixed steps of `PhysParams::dt`; `Stepper` turns frame time
  into whole steps and carries the remainder (at most `max_substeps` per call).
- Two worlds built the same way and stepped the same way are bit-identical, with and
  without a character moving and jumping among a dozen tumbling boxes (`state_digest`
  over every body's position and velocity bits, every step) [observed: tests, same
  process]. Cross-platform identity is what `enhanced-determinism` is for
  [hypothesis: not yet compared across machines; CI runs the tests on Linux only and
  compares nothing between machines].
- Bodies are created in call order, and rapier's results depend on it [hypothesis, as for
  any solver]; the tools add terrain by grid and references by FormID. Queries that
  return several colliders sort them.
- **Building off the world**: `add_ref` and `add_terrain` are `PreparedRef::new` /
  `PreparedTerrain::new` (pure: shapes, poses, no world) followed by `insert_ref` /
  `insert_terrain`, so the shapes can be built on another thread; the two halves give the
  same bodies in the same order as the one call [observed: parity-lab L4 results
  identical to the code before the split]. The game prepares cells on a loader thread and
  inserts them in the order it asked for them, a cell's references by FormID, whatever
  order the thread finishes in; its tests find the world bit-identical (state digest,
  loaded cells, stats) whether the loader finishes cells forwards or backwards, to loading
  every cell on the main thread, and between two runs [observed: tests in
  `engine/nvf-play/src/phys/tests.rs`] (docs/design/layer4-play.md §6).
- **Snapshots**: `PhysWorld::snapshot` copies the whole world (bodies, colliders, contact
  graph, islands, broad phase); stepping the copy and the original with the same inputs
  stays bit-identical, a character included [observed: test
  `snapshot_continues_identically`].
- **rapier quirk**: bringing queries up to date between steps runs rapier's collision-only
  pipeline, which consumes the change flags of newly inserted bodies without registering
  them for simulation; a dynamic body added and then queried (or added while a character
  moves, since `move_character` updates queries first) never moved [observed: test
  `bodies_added_then_queried_still_simulate`, rapier 0.36.0]. `update_queries` flags such
  bodies changed again so the next step registers them. Re-check when upgrading rapier.
- **f32 range**: a ray–sphere test from about 10,000 units away was off by about one unit
  (cancellation in the quadratic), from 100 units by under 0.01 [observed: tests]. Probes
  and activation rays should start near what they test; `fnvtool phys` starts ground rays
  1,000 units above the highest loaded terrain.

## 6. Character controller and capture questions

A kinematic vertical body standing on its feet point, over rapier's
`KinematicCharacterController` with up = +Z: slides along walls, steps up ledges up to
`step_height`, refuses and slides down slopes steeper than `max_slope_deg`, settles down
onto the ground on descents (within `step_height`), integrates its own vertical speed under
gravity, jumps with `v = sqrt(2·g·jump_height)` when grounded, stops rising when the head
hits something, reports touchdown speed (fall damage input) and pushes dynamic bodies.
Since 2026-10-08 (§6.4.1) the body is a cylinder of radius 22 on a cone bottom (flat tip of
radius 3.2, rising 1.58 per unit), off walkable ground the vertical motion does not slide
(a falling body stays where it touches, at any steepness), and the horizontal velocity
follows the game's air and landing rules (`fnv_phys::air`).
Its kinematic body makes dynamic bodies collide with it. Activation targeting is a ray
from the eye that excludes the caster (`Filter::excluding(character.key())`).

Values of `CharacterParams` / `PhysParams` and how each is (or will be) measured. Jobs
named here run unattended (`tools/capture/jobs/make_movement_jobs.py`, §6.3); "owner"
means someone at the game.

| Parameter | Value used | Status / how measured |
|---|---|---|
| gravity | 686.7 units/s² (9.81 m/s² at 70 units/m) | **[observed]** 683.8 (300-unit fall) and 685.5 (standing jump), §6.3; kept |
| fixed step `dt` | 1/60 s | unknown; the game ran at 60–64 loops per second during captures [observed] |
| body radius | 22 | **[observed, §6.4.1]** from `mv_diag_fence_edge`: drops rested on the fence edge 22.6 off it (radius + 0.7 shell ≥ 22.6) and fell at 25.7; the game stops 21.45 from the fence face (`move_fence_stop`, face measured to 0.05), which would give 20.75: about 1.2 apart, not explained; the candidate now stops 22.7 from the face (keeping a static shell's 0.7 from walls, no longer the terrain's 3.5) |
| bottom shape | cone: flat tip of radius 3.2, then rising 1.58 per unit to the radius | **[observed, §6.4.1]** fitted to 26 fence-edge drops from 50 and 200 units (RMS 2.9); the depth depends on the speed of the fall, which the model does not have |
| capsule height | 128 | [hypothesis]; owner (head against a low ceiling of known height, standing and crouched) |
| step height | 24 | [hypothesis]; `move_porch_steps` exercises steps of Doc Mitchell's porch; the limit needs ledges of graded heights (design open, §6.3) |
| max slope | 45° | [hypothesis]; an unattended run up steep LAND squares is possible (design open, §6.3) |
| jump apex | 61.6 | **[observed]** apex 61.6 above the standing feet, §6.3 (`fJumpHeightMin` reads 64) |
| air control | gain 0.30 per 1/60 s towards the keys' velocity (full when a key was held at take-off or pressed within 4 steps after it, else 14.7 units/s); release decays with the same gain | **[observed]** `mv_air`, `mv_air2` (§6.4.1); `fJumpMoveMult` reads 0.30 |
| landing | fixed speed profiles for 29 steps after a touchdown above 100 units/s, forward and backward | **[observed]** `mv_air`, `mv_air2` (§6.4.1); the 100 threshold and sideways landings [hypothesis] |
| max fall speed | none | none: a 2,500-unit fall reached 1,841 units/s still accelerating (fit g = 686.0, RMS 0.09) [observed: `mv_values`] |
| walk / run speed | `nvf-play` uses 86.8 / 344 | **[observed]**, §6.3 |
| eye height | 112 (`nvf-play`) | about 123 above the feet if the crosshair pick is a sphere of `fActivatePickSphereRadius` 16 cast from above the feet (both distances agree); a plain ray fits only with the camera 10.6 units behind the feet (110 above them) [observed: `mv_values`, §6.3; the model is hypothesis]; not changed yet |
| activation reach | 150 (`nvf-play` `pick::REACH`) | `iActivatePickLength` reads 150, `fActivatePickSphereRadius` 16; at 30° down the crosshair found the fence up to a feet-to-face distance of 120 and not from 123 [observed: `mv_values`]: 122–126 along the view with the sphere model, 139–142 for a plain ray; not changed yet |
| push mass | 80 | [hypothesis]; owner (how far walking pushes a known clutter item) |
| layers the player passes through | §4 list | B11 job `mv_b11_drops` and scenario `L4.phys.drops.b11_goodsprings`, ready (§4.2) |
| CollisionMarker bounds | half extents | three CollisionMarker tops in `mv_b11_drops`: read as full extents they would be 6.5, 65 and 34.5 units lower (§4.2) |

Settings stored in FalloutNV.esm whose names suggest movement or falling (values
[observed] from the GMST records; meanings [hypothesis] from the names only):
`fMoveBaseSpeed` 77, `fMoveRunMult` 4, `fMoveSneakMult` 0.57, `fJumpFallHeightMin` 600,
`fJumpFallHeightExponent` 1.65, `fJumpFallVelocityMin` 2785, `fJumpSwimmingMult` 2.
Settings that are not overridden in the masters keep defaults inside the executable,
which is not read (charter). Questions for the owner:

1. Can you record the measurements in the table on a pinned save (console `getpos` /
   `setpos`), or should an xNVSE logging plugin sample the player's position per frame?
2. ~~Is the player's `GetPos Z` the feet (bottom of the capsule)?~~ Yes [observed by the owner in game, 2026-10-08]:
   in Doc Mitchell's house the lowest object, a rug, has `GetPos Z` 7360 and the player
   standing on it 7361.05 (a first aid box on the lowest shelf 7389.94); a capsule centre
   would be about half the capsule height higher.
3. ~~Do disabled references block movement?~~ No: they are not drawn, have no collision
   and no interaction [observed by the owner in game, 2026-10-08] (§4).
4. **Collision layer matrix** (open): which layers block the player and which block
   dropped items. Designed and ready (§4.2): jobs `mv_b11_drops` (player) and
   `mv_b11_clutter` (a bottle), no one at the controls.

### 6.1 The player in the game (`engine/nvf-play`, Layer 4 Part P)

`nvforever --play` drives the controller above with the default `CharacterParams`. Values
it adds:

| Value | Used | Status |
|---|---|---|
| walk speed | 86.8 units/s (`MoveSpeeds::OBSERVED`) | [observed: §6.3, a level-1 character, Speed Mult 100; the formula (encumbrance, sneaking, weapon out) is unknown; `fMoveBaseSpeed` is 77] |
| run speed | 344 units/s | [observed: §6.3; `fMoveBaseSpeed × fMoveRunMult` would be 308] |
| run by default, Shift walks | | [observed: Always Run is on in the owner's game and the Run control is bound to left Shift, §6.3] |
| backwards at 0.79 of the forward speed (`BACK_SPEED_FRACTION`); sideways and diagonals at the forward speed, diagonals not faster | | [observed: backwards 272.8 against 344, §6.3; sideways and diagonals hypothesis] |
| eye height above the feet | 112 units | [hypothesis: placeholder for a standing human at about 70 units per metre] |
| the player reference's z rotation is its compass heading in radians | written to the simulation each frame | [hypothesis: door teleport markers' rotations are read the same way] |
| physics (and the game clock) stop in menus | | [hypothesis: not captured for the container menu] |
| swimming | water per loaded cell; swim speed 339 (Shift 86) in every direction along the view, with the stroke cycle of `fnv_phys::swim` for running; a start above deep water falls in | [observed: §6.6] |

Engineering choices, not game values: mouse look 0.0025 rad per mouse count, pitch
limited to ±89°; physics loads the 3×3 exterior cells around the player (one more ring
before unloading) or the one interior, at most one cell per frame, the player's own cell
first, and the character waits while its cell is not loaded; the start drops the
character on whatever a downward ray from the start eye finds (outdoors from far above if
nothing; indoors the start moves to a door arrival, §6.7), on the hit's contact shell (§6.2); `Travel` puts the character where the arrival rule of
§6.2 says (`PhysState::arrive_player` → `PhysWorld::arrival`); a character more than 1,000 units below the
terrain is put back on the ground (logged as a warning); indoors, §6.7.

References get collision by the same rule as `fnvtool phys cell`
(`fnv_phys::ref_collision`); whether one is in the world is the simulation's: not
deleted, enabled following its enable parents (`World::is_enabled`), not taken; until the
simulation holds state for a reference, its own Initially Disabled flag also keeps it out
(as render streaming and `fnvtool phys` do). In Goodsprings' 3×3 that gives 839
references with collision against `fnvtool phys cell`'s 849 [observed: `nvforever --play`
debug log: 18 references not in the world, the 8 that `fnvtool` also counts as Initially
Disabled and 10 that the simulation disables through their enable parents].

Seen in NVForever, not in the game [observed]: walking east into the rock 0x000EDE82
(layer Terrain) at about (-31043, -18055) the capsule jittered in place (about 85 units/s
of back-and-forth path) and crept up 0.2 units/s; `fnvtool phys walk` from
(-31455, -18200) at velocity (600, 0) reproduced it to the unit, so it was the
controller's, not the game integration's. **Cause** [observed: per-step trace]: the
capsule was pressed into a concave corner of the rock's mesh; rapier's controller slides
along one face at a time, the slide along one face pushed it into the other, and the
position cycled with a period of three steps, about 2 units of y per step. **Fix**
(`fnv_phys::character::wedged`): the walls hit while sliding, plus the walls the capsule
already touches (contact manifolds within its gap + 0.5), are collected as horizontal
normals; when every wall the motion pushes into would, after sliding along it, push into
another, the step is re-run without horizontal motion (the multi-plane clip of sliding
controllers: the only free direction is up the crease, which a wall too steep to climb
does not allow). The same walk now stops at (-31047.1, -18053.9) and stays there to
0.01 units, z constant within 0.007 (test `character_wedged_in_a_corner_stays_put` uses
notches of 20°, 30° and 45°; without the rule it fails with 0.5 units of back-and-forth
per second). A slow settling deeper into a narrow notch (under 1 unit/s, monotone) can
remain; it is real free space, not oscillation.

A second rapier quirk found while testing [observed: rapier 0.36.0]: when the sweep meets
an exactly level surface (normal straight up) its slope tangent direction is degenerate,
and if the computed tangent dips a hair below horizontal the whole remaining horizontal
motion of the step is dropped: once in 60 steps of a walk along a terrain cell seam the
character moved 0.06 units instead of 1.28. `move_character` continues such a step with
the horizontal motion it lost, only when every hit of the step was level (test
`walking_on_level_ground_loses_no_step`). Re-check both when upgrading rapier.

### 6.2 Rest height after a teleport (arrival rule)

Question: why does the player stand at z 8693.87 after leaving Doc Mitchell's house when
the door's XTEL destination is at z 8686.43 (`L4.sim.trace.goodsprings_doc_mitchell`)?

Facts:

- Under the destination (-73162.93, 1312.43) there is only terrain in our collision
  world: the LAND surface, split along the south-west → north-east diagonal (§3), is at
  8690.03 there; the nearest collision of the house (SCOL 0x001788D9, its porch ramp)
  ends about 25 units west; the navmesh triangle under the point (NAVM 0x00177F70,
  triangle 333, the door's XNDP) is at 8689.72 [observed: `fnvtool phys cell` probes on
  a 20-unit grid; NAVM read as NVVX 12-byte vertices and NVTR 16-byte triangles,
  [documented: xEdit]]. So the destination is 3.6 units *under* the terrain and the
  player ends 3.84 above it; no other object, DLC record or enable state explains it
  [observed: the same with all ten masters].
- **Every NIF collision shape of the corpus stores a `radius` of 0.1** besides its
  geometry (box, convex vertices, packed and plain triangle strips: 12,000+ objects in
  `Fallout - Meshes.bsa`; the rest are sphere/capsule-only bodies whose radius is their
  geometry) [observed: `fnvtool collide survey` `shell_radius_by_layer`; field
  [documented: nif.xml]]. At the Havok scale of 7 that is 0.7 game units.
- In-game rest heights [observed, unattended captures 2026-10-08 on the `nvfdoc` save,
  jobs in `tools/capture/jobs/`]. Δ is the player's `GetPos Z` minus the bare surface
  under the point (LAND surface or our collision's static floor):

  | Arrival | Destination vs surface | Δ (settled) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Doc Mitchell's front door (golden; rerun three times) | 3.6 below terrain | 3.844 (rises over ~300 loops from 3.29 at the first loop) |
  | doors 0x00105653, 0x00105690, 0x00105D48 | on the terrain surface | 3.848, 3.848, 3.848 |
  | door 0x00105615 | 8.0 below terrain | 3.484 |
  | door 0x00105652 | 3.53 above terrain | 3.323 (sank 0.21) |
  | door 0x00108F3F | 26.5 above terrain | 3.395 (fell) |
  | door 0x00105BD6 | 2.45 below a static (0x00101CA6) | 0.537 |
  | door 0x00106373 (interior) | 0.53 above the floor | 0.601 |
  | door 0x00105228 (interior) | 24 above the floor | 0.572 (fell) |
  | Doc Mitchell's house from outside (twice) | on the floor | 0.586, 0.553 |
  | `SetPos` drop onto Doc Mitchell's porch (twice) | 61 above the SCOL floor | 1.040, 1.040 |
  | standing on a rug in the house (owner) | on the floor | 1.05 |

  So the player rests in a band **0.54–1.05 above static floors (0.7 − 0.16 to
  0.7 + 0.35) and 3.32–3.85 above the LAND surface**: the same band shifted by 2.8. The
  destination's own height hardly matters (from 8 below to 26 above). Which height in
  the band an arrival ends at is not explained (two arrivals on the bare terrain surface
  and one on a bare floor went to opposite ends).
- Placements by `SetPos` behave alike near the surface (placed 0.5 above flat terrain the
  player rose to 3.39 within 360 loops; placed at 3.85 it stayed) but drops after
  `SetPos` are not reliable evidence: the player sometimes hung in the air for hundreds of
  loops or stopped 7–11 units above the terrain (`dt_rest_detail`) [observed]; why is
  open.
- The terrain's triangulation is confirmed in game: two drops in the non-planar square
  under the destination rested 3.853 and 3.857 above the south-west → north-east split
  and 5.85 / 5.46 above the other [observed: `dt_teleport_rest` p11, p12].

**Rule** (`fnv_phys::arrival`, used by `fnvtool sim run` and `nvforever --play`'s door
travel): a vertical ray from half a capsule above the destination to four capsules below
finds the support; the feet rest on its **contact shell**: `z = surface + shell`, with
the shell of a model's collision object = its largest stored `radius` × 7 × the
reference's scale (`CollisionObject::shell`) and the terrain's `TERRAIN_SHELL` = 3.5
(0.7 + 2.8 from the table) [observed: derived]. That the shells are Havok convex radii,
the terrain's being 0.5 Havok units, is [hypothesis]; so is the band above the shell (the
upper end, +0.35, would be a character "keep distance" of 0.05 Havok units). The rule
reproduces every arrival above within −0.18…+0.35 (the band); for Doc Mitchell's door it
gives 8693.53 against the observed 8693.87. Without a support in range the actor stays
at the destination. History: a first version put the feet at shell + 0.35 (fitted to
Doc Mitchell's door and the porch); its predictions for `dt_door_arrivals` were written
before that capture, which then showed arrivals at both ends of the band, so the rule
now uses the shell, near the middle of what was observed (Δ − shell averages +0.10 over the
fifteen values in the table), rather than the end that matches
the scenario's golden.

**The walking controller keeps the same shells** (`CharacterParams::rest_gap`, one rule
for both: the support's shell, at least the numerical `skin`). Each step a short
downward sweep of the body finds the support and its gap; a body closer than that to a
walkable support (after walking from a static floor onto terrain, after a
`place_character`, on landing) is lifted to it, never into a ceiling, and after the move
it settles onto the support at exactly that gap (pulled down within `step_height` when the
step started on the ground). The distance rapier's controller keeps from everything it
sweeps against (its offset) is a static shell, 0.7, or the support's gap when smaller:
until 2026-10-08 it was the support's gap, so a character on terrain kept 3.5 from walls
(§6.4.1). On level ground a character dropped or walking comes to rest at
`surface + shell`, the arrival rule's height, and stays there (within 0.01 over a
second, the controller's nudges) [observed: tests `character_rests_on_contact_shells`,
`arrival_rests_on_the_support_shell`; `fnvtool phys cell` probes at Doc Mitchell's door
rest 3.55 above the terrain under the feet, 8693.56 against the arrival rule's 8693.53 and
the game's 8693.87, and at the porch drop of `dt_rest_detail` 0.71 above the SCOL floor
against the game's 1.04]. On a slope the capsule keeps the gap along the surface normal,
as a convex radius would, so its feet stand `gap / cos(slope)` above the surface under
the capsule's lowest point [hypothesis: unmeasured in game]. Consequences of rapier
having one offset per character: every obstacle is kept at 0.7 (terrain walls too, whose
own shell would be 3.5) [hypothesis]; walking from terrain onto a static floor flush with it the feet drop by 2.8,
and back again they rise by 2.8 within a step, which matches the band shift but whose
timing in game is not observed. Open: what places an arrival inside the band (−0.18 …
+0.35), and the in-game rest band of a standing player over time.

### 6.3 The player measured in game (`mv_trial`, unattended)

Capture `tools/capture/jobs/mv_trial.steps.json` (2026-10-08, save `nvfdoc`: a level-1
character in Doc Mitchell's house, god mode and AI detection off; the job leaves through
the front door and works on flat LAND at z 8352 around (-72400, 4100)). Method facts
[observed]:

- Held keys move the player with no one at the controls: xNVSE `HoldKey` / `ReleaseKey`
  with the scan code `GetControl <control>` returns (forward 17 = W, back 31, crouch 29,
  run 42 = left Shift, always run 58, jump 57 = Space), and `TapControl 12` jumps
  [documented: GECK wiki, control codes; observed: they work].
- Time base: `GetCurrentTime` (game hours) at TimeScale 30 gives real milliseconds as
  `(hours − start) × 120000`; its steps (15–16 ms, 31 ms when a loop took two frames)
  match `GetSecondsPassed`, which works in a reused query (the plugin compiles each text
  once). Positions lag that clock by one loop: pairing each position with the previous
  loop's clock, a quadratic fits a fall with 0.15 units RMS and a jump with 0.05 (without
  the lag 1.66 and 0.51). After a `SetPos` the world sometimes stood still (positions and
  clock frozen) for up to ~170 loops.
- `$` of a float gives six significant digits ("1234.57"); positions as text keep 0.01.

Values [observed]:

| Quantity | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| gravity | 683.8 (fall from 300 above the ground), 685.5 (standing jump) units/s² | quadratic fits, 54 and 51 samples |
| standing jump | take-off 290.6 units/s, apex 61.6 above the standing feet (8355.85 → 8417.54), 0.845 s in the air | `fJumpHeightMin` reads 64 [observed: GetNumericGameSetting]; how it relates is [hypothesis] |
| run (Always Run on, forward held) | 344.0 units/s over 1 s; 0.25-s windows 322–355; positions within 3.2 of a constant speed | full speed from the first loop (5.44 units in the first 16 ms) |
| walk (Run key held too; IsRunning 0) | 86.8 units/s over 1.45 s; windows 84–91 | run / walk = 3.96 (`fMoveRunMult` 4) |
| rest heights | standing 8355.85 (3.85 above LAND); after the fall 8355.85; after the jump 8357.08 (5.08) | the jump landing is 1.2 above the band of §6.2 |
| settings | `fMoveBaseSpeed` 77, `fMoveRunMult` 4, `fJumpHeightMin` 64, `iActivatePickLength` 150; INI `fJumpAnimDelay:HAVOK` 0.75, `fActivatePickSphereRadius:Interface` 16; Speed Mult 100, scale 1, TimeScale 30, IsRunning 1 | read with GetNumericGameSetting / GetNumericINISetting; setting names [documented: GECK wiki GetCrosshairRef (`iActivatePickLength`), public console guides (`fJumpHeightMin`), stepmodifications.org list of FNV INI defaults (the INI names)] |

Used: `CharacterParams::jump_height` = 61.6; `nvf-play` walks at 86.8 and runs at 344
(`MoveSpeeds::OBSERVED`); gravity stays 686.7 (within 0.4% of both fits). Run and walk
are 11.7% and 12.7% above `fMoveBaseSpeed × fMoveRunMult` and `fMoveBaseSpeed`; the
formula (animation, equipment, encumbrance) is unknown.

Movement scenarios designed from this (`L4.phys.walk.*`, inputs
`parity-lab/inputs/layer4/move_*.walk.json`, job `mv_traces`, golden builder
`tools/capture/capture_moves.py`): the candidate walks at the observed 344 units/s along
the heading the game uses, and its feet every 0.25 s after the run starts are compared
with the game's positions interpolated at the same times after the movement onset
(tolerance 10). The trial's own run is not used as a golden (its speed was measured from
it). Predictions of the candidate (2026-10-08, before capture), feet (x, y, z):

- `move_fence_slide` (start [-72400.0, 4100.0, 8355.5]): t0.25 (-72435.3, 4160.1, 8355.5); t0.50 (-72433.6, 4219.0, 8355.5); t0.75 (-72432.6, 4275.2, 8355.5); t1.00 (-72432.6, 4336.0, 8355.5); t1.25 (-72432.6, 4396.8, 8355.5); t1.50 (-72432.6, 4457.6, 8355.5)
- `move_fence_stop` (start [-72400.0, 4100.0, 8355.5]): t0.25 (-72436.0, 4101.5, 8355.5); t0.50 (-72436.0, 4104.0, 8355.5); t0.75 (-72436.1, 4106.4, 8355.5); t1.00 (-72436.2, 4108.7, 8355.5); t1.25 (-72436.2, 4111.1, 8355.5); t1.50 (-72436.3, 4113.5, 8355.5)
- `move_running_jump` (start [-72400.0, 4100.0, 8355.5]): t0.25 (-72400.0, 4186.0, 8405.3); t0.50 (-72400.0, 4272.0, 8412.2); t0.75 (-72400.0, 4358.0, 8376.2); t1.00 (-72400.0, 4444.0, 8355.5); t1.25 (-72400.0, 4530.0, 8355.7); t1.50 (-72400.0, 4616.0, 8355.5)
- `move_porch_steps` (start [-73162.93, 1312.43, 8693.53]): t0.25 (-73230.4, 1291.4, 8717.2); t0.50 (-73299.1, 1270.0, 8739.6); t0.75 (-73314.6, 1264.4, 8739.3); t1.00 (-73314.3, 1263.5, 8739.3); t1.25 (-73314.0, 1262.7, 8739.3); t1.50 (-73313.8, 1261.9, 8739.3)

Expected differences worth watching: the stop distance from the fence (`move_fence_stop`:
the candidate keeps radius 18 + its 3.5 gap from walls while standing on terrain, 21.3 from
the face), the slide speed along the fence, the jump arc (apex 61.6 now), and whether the
porch steps are climbed at the same places.

Still open, designs not made yet: the step-height limit (needs ledges of graded heights
in reach of a save), the slope limit (a run up LAND squares of known steepness), the
capsule height (owner), push mass (owner).

**Scenario captures** (`mv_traces`, `mv_values`, 2026-10-08, coordinator) [observed]:

- `move_fence_slide` and `move_fence_stop` agree 6/6 (within 1 unit in x and y; the game
  stands 3.85 above LAND against the candidate's 3.5).
- `move_porch_steps`: up the 32° porch ramp the game moved 288 units/s horizontally and
  134 vertically, 316 along the surface after the flat run of 340 (and 333 along the
  30° LAND of `move_hill_run`, 306 + 134): the run speed is kept along a walkable slope
  (the cosine), where sliding the flat velocity gave the cosine squared (244). The
  controller now keeps the speed along uphill walkable slopes, in the vertical plane of
  the heading (`move_hill_run` showed the game keeps its heading across a side slope). It
  passes 6/6; still open: at the top the game stood 7.7 above the porch floor (8746.34
  against 8739.3) after rising above the ramp's end.
- `move_running_jump` 0/6, open. Jump and run started in the same loop: the horizontal
  speed rose 102, 173, 223 … 340 over 0.2 s (the gap to 340 shrinking by 0.70 per loop)
  while the candidate runs at 344 from the first step; after landing two loops at 81
  units/s and later dips to 144–239. Calibration `mv_air` [observed]: jumping out of a
  run at full speed keeps 340 in the air; releasing forward in mid-air decays the speed
  by about 0.84 per loop (to 27 in 0.22 s); pressing forward only after leaving the
  ground gives 15 units/s. **Resolved 2026-10-08** (§6.4.1): one rule fits all four
  (gain 0.30 per loop towards the keys' velocity when a key was down at take-off, else
  towards 14.7; `fJumpMoveMult` reads 0.30), and the landing slowdown is a fixed speed
  profile after every landing with a key held; the scenario passes 6/6.
- Other speeds (`mv_values`) [observed]: backwards 272.8 units/s (0.79 of forward; used by
  `nvf-play`), sneaking forward 197.7 (= 344 × 0.575; `fMoveSneakMult` is 0.57); the strafe
  and diagonal runs hit the yard's house and are not usable.

### 6.4 Follow-up captures: predictions (written 2026-10-08 before the runs)

After the first scenario captures (results in §4.2 and §6.3) the candidate changed: probes
load the cells around their own square, open-by-default doors lose their keyframed parts,
Portal Box CollisionMarkers are left out, and the speed up walkable slopes is kept along
the surface. Predictions of that candidate for the next jobs (`mv_followup_traces`,
held-out scenarios `L4.phys.walk.hill_run` and `.portal_wall`; `mv_diag_trees_rocks`,
diagnostic, final feet z):

- `move_hill_run` (start [-76900.0, -3840.0, 8330.75] ): t0.25 (-76979.4, -3851.2, 8360.9); t0.50 (-77058.3, -3865.0, 8389.4); t0.75 (-77137.2, -3878.7, 8417.9); t1.00 (-77214.3, -3893.9, 8449.9); t1.25 (-77288.4, -3913.1, 8486.3); t1.50 (-77363.9, -3931.6, 8520.3)
- `move_portal_wall` (start [-77757.7, 4910.6, 10651.98] ): t0.25 (-77699.7, 4847.0, 10592.9); t0.50 (-77641.7, 4783.5, 10500.2); t0.75 (-77583.7, 4720.0, 10370.6); t1.00 (-77525.7, 4656.5, 10330.5); t1.25 (-77467.7, 4593.0, 10247.6); t1.50 (-77409.7, 4529.5, 10121.7)
- `diag_trees_rocks`: tree_a_-30_-30 8575.0; tree_a_-30_+0 8582.7; tree_a_-30_+30 8582.7; tree_a_+0_-30 8588.8; tree_a_+0_+0 8582.7; tree_a_+0_+30 8368.4; tree_a_+30_-30 8545.8; tree_a_+30_+0 8545.4; tree_a_+30_+30 8358.7; rock_b_-30_-30 8515.3; rock_b_-30_+0 8516.1; rock_b_-30_+30 8480.5; rock_b_+0_-30 8514.6; rock_b_+0_+0 8515.1; rock_b_+0_+30 8482.2; rock_b_+30_-30 8509.1; rock_b_+30_+0 8496.4; rock_b_+30_+30 8498.6; tree_a_high 8582.7

`mv_air` (calibration, no prediction used): horizontal motion when forward is pressed in
mid-air, when jumping out of a run at full speed, when forward is released in mid-air,
and in a walking jump.

**Results of the follow-ups** (captures by this workstream, 2026-10-08) [observed]:

- `move_portal_wall`: the game stopped 22.1 units from the plane of the Portal Box marker
  0x001685B9 (−77689.5, 4840.2) and stayed: the prediction (pass through, from the rule
  derived from one drop) was wrong; Portal Box markers are solid again. With the rule
  reverted the candidate also stops there. On the way down (a 42° slope) the game left
  the ground and fell (vertical speed growing like gravity) where the candidate keeps
  snapping to the slope: z differs by 47 at t0.25; snapping down steep slopes is open.
- `move_hill_run`: the game ran straight west at 306 horizontal + 134 vertical; the
  prediction drifted 87 units south (the slope projection also turned the motion
  downhill), fixed by keeping the heading (above). Golden onset: the builder first took
  the movement onset at a 0.08–0.1 change in z one sample (0.031 s of game clock) before
  the run started, so the first goldens' observation times were 0.031 s early. The
  builder now uses the horizontal position (`capture_moves.py`), and on the owner's
  decision (2026-10-08) both goldens were replaced by a rebuild from the same raw capture
  (layer4-captures.md §1, log). Against the rebuild hill_run passes 6/6 and portal_wall
  5/6: only the airborne z at t0.25 differs (−46.7). Before the replacement, the same
  candidate scored 3/6 and 4/6. Both results were seen before the rebuild was installed,
  so these two scenarios are no longer independent held-out evidence. A fresh
  re-capture to confirm the onset within the game's spread is still to be made.
- `mv_diag_trees_rocks` (drops on a ±30 grid; candidate as now):

| Drop | Game feet (x, y, z) | Candidate z | Δz |
|---|---|---|---|
| tree_a_-30_-30 | (-74330.2, -1196.8, 8693.22) | 8575.04 | +118.2 |
| tree_a_-30_+0 | (-74330.2, -1166.8, 8625.73) | 8582.72 | +43.0 |
| tree_a_-30_+30 | (-74330.2, -1136.8, 8667.81) | 8582.72 | +85.1 |

  Rock b agrees within 4 units at 7 of 9 points (and the game's own repeat of the B11
  centre drop came 6.3 higher than the first), so the rock geometry is right and the B11
  rock rows differ by the game's spread and edge effects [observed]. On the tree the game
  rests 43–303 units higher at every point, where it also stands on nothing in our mesh
  (+0/+30, +30/+30, which the candidate falls through to the ground); its heights follow
  the highest vertex of the branch mesh within 18 units of the drop (within 0–20 at 6 of
  9 points) rather than its convex hull (250–330 higher). Hypothesis: the game's
  controller comes to rest on thin, steep branch triangles and their edges, where rapier's
  controller slides off them. Confirmed in part (§6.4.1): the game's falling player does
  not slide off steep contacts, and its bottom is not a capsule's; the controller now
  rests within 8 at 4 of these 9 points and 8–18 low at the others (tree centre open).

### 6.4.1 Air control and the player's bottom: analysis and predictions (2026-10-08, before `mv_air2` and `mv_diag_fence_edge`)

**Air control, from `mv_air` and the running-jump capture, loop by loop** [observed;
speeds from consecutive positions; loops are 15–16 ms, occasionally 31]:

- With a movement key held in the air the horizontal speed approaches a target by a fixed
  fraction per loop: in the running jump (Forward and Jump in the same loop, taking off
  in the loop the motion starts) 102.1, 172.9, 223.5, 257.8, 282.1, 299.5 … 339.5: the gap
  to 339.5 shrinks by 0.70 every loop (first loop 0.30 × 339.5 = 101.9). Jumping out of a
  run at speed, the speed just after take-off was about 366 and fell back to 339.5 the same
  way (gap × 0.7). Forward pressed 8 loops after the take-off of a standing jump: 7.3,
  10.0, 11.2, 12.0, 13.1, 13.7 … about 14.7 (gap × about 0.7), and stayed there.
- With no key (Forward released 8 loops after a running take-off) the speed falls 214,
  181, 153, 128, 108, 88, 70.5, 54, 38.7, 26.8, 18.7, 13.7 …: × 0.845 per loop above
  100 units/s, × 0.70 below 40.
- **The landing is a fixed speed profile.** After every landing with a movement key held
  the per-loop displacements are the same, loop for loop, whatever the speed in the air
  (15 or 340) and whether walking or running: about 81 units/s for two loops, then 341,
  365, 386, 391, 329, 293, 280, 288, 309, 312, 320, 319, 308, 308, 276, 274, 207, 192,
  160, 144, 175, 239, 379, 382, 394, then 339.5 (four captures: the running-jump
  scenario, `mv_air` run-then-jump, late forward and walk jump; a walking jump lands into
  run speeds). With no key held the player stays put after landing. That is the "two loops
  at 81 and dips to 144–239" of the scenario; the profile looks like an animation's root
  speed [hypothesis].
- No game setting stored in the masters mentions air control, acceleration or friction
  (all GMSTs searched: movement settings are `fMoveBaseSpeed`, `fMoveRunMult`,
  `fMoveSneakMult`, armour/leg penalties, `fJump*` fall damage and `fJumpSwimmingMult`)
  [observed]. The game's INI `[HAVOK]` section has `fJumpAnimDelay` 0.75 and `fMaxTime`
  0.016 among unnamed-purpose values [observed: Fallout_default.ini, read-only]. For
  Oblivion's engine `fJumpMoveBase` and `fJumpMoveMult` are said to govern air control
  [documented: UESP CS wiki, Category:Jumping]; whether this game has them is read by
  `mv_air2`.

Hypothesis H (to be tested by `mv_air2`): in the air the horizontal velocity moves 0.30
of the way to a target each loop; the target is the key's ground velocity when a
movement key was held at take-off, and a small air control (about 15 units/s, 0.043 of
the run speed) when it was not; with no key the speed decays (× 0.845, faster when slow).
Predictions of H for `mv_air2`: *repress* back to 340 (gain 0.3); *back in air* reverses
towards −272 within about 10 loops; *right in air* turns towards the forward-right
diagonal at 340; *back jump* rises to 272 backwards like the running jump forward, then
the landing profile backwards; *forward after 1* (key down before the take-off) 340,
*forward after 3* 15; *walk release* and *apex release* decay as above; *fall forward*
(no take-off) 15 in the air; *press after landing*: the landing profile from its third
loop if it is tied to the landing, plain 340 if tied to the key press.

**The player's bottom against thin geometry.** Sweeping shapes straight down onto our
collision of the B11 tree (`fnvtool phys cell` with a sweep probe, not kept) [observed]:
an 18-unit capsule's first contact is 9–40 units from the game's rest height, both above
and below; the candidate's controller ends 43–303 units under any first contact,
because rapier's controller slides a falling capsule off contacts steeper than the slope
limit, while the game's player stays where it is (its x/y did not change in any tree
drop). No single capsule or flat cylinder radius puts every first contact at or above
the game's rest height except capsules of 26 or more, and those leave the game 4–19
lower. On rock b an 18-unit capsule's first contact matches within 4 at 7 of 9 points.

`mv_diag_fence_edge` (drops 200 above the yard fence's top, which is 3.5 units wide at
8422.4 with LAND at 8352 on both sides, at offsets d from its centre line). Predictions:
the candidate (radius 18, sliding) rests on the top for |d| ≤ 8 (8423.1 at 0, 8421.9 at
+8), slides off to the ground (8355.5) at +12, ±16, ±20, holds 8420.35 at −12, and ends on
the ground beyond. A non-sliding capsule of radius r would rest at 8423.1 − (r −
√(r² − (|d| − 1.75)²)) for |d| − 1.75 < r (r = 18: 8419.6 at 12, 8415.7 at 16; r = 24:
8414.2 at 20, 8407.2 at 24); a flat bottom would stay at 8423.1 out to |d| = r + 1.75.

**Predictions for `mv_diag_fence_low`** (written 2026-10-08 after `mv_diag_fence_edge` and
before this run; the same fence offsets dropped from 10 and 50 above the top, and three
tree-a points from 12 and 50 above the game's earlier rest). Two hypotheses: (C) the
bottom is a cone, sinking 1.46 per unit off the edge whatever the fall: every fence rest
as in `mv_diag_fence_edge` (8411.9 at ±8, 8406.0 at ±12, 8400.2 at ±16, 8394.3 at ±20,
8388.5 at ±24) and the tree points back at their earlier rests or lower; (I) the depth
grows with the speed of the fall (the fence drops fell about 230 units and sank up to 31,
the tree-centre drop fell 118 and sank about 0, the tree drop from 400 above rested 10
lower than from 200, and the `shallow_a` drop that fell 14 units rests above every
shape's first contact): from 10 above the fence rests near a capsule of radius 22.5
(8420 at ±8, 8418 at ±12, 8414 at ±16, 8412 at ±20, 8408 at ±24) and the tree points
at or above their earlier rests.

**Results** (captures by this workstream, 2026-10-08, save `nvfdoc`) [observed]:

- `mv_air2` (a first run recorded no motion at all: held keys and tapped jumps did nothing
  while `SetPos` still worked; the rerun moved normally; cause not known, possibly the
  game window without input focus). Settings: **`fJumpMoveMult` 0.30**, `fJumpMoveBase` 0,
  `fJumpDoubleMult` 0.5, `fJumpFallTimeMin` −1, `fJumpHeightMin` 64 (the 0.30 equals the
  air gain measured loop by loop; that the setting is that gain is [hypothesis]).
  - *repress*: Forward released 10 loops after a running take-off (speed 232, 189, 156,
    126, 103, 82: × 0.81–0.83 per loop), pressed again: back to 340 with the gap × 0.70 per
    loop. H confirmed: a key held at take-off keeps the full target for the whole jump.
  - *back in air*: the velocity reverses towards −271 (the backward run speed) with the
    gap × 0.70; *right in air*: it turns towards the forward-right diagonal at 340 (240,
    240) the same way (then the player hit the yard's house). The full target is the keys'
    ground velocity in any direction.
  - *back jump* (Back and Jump together): the take-off came one loop after the key, so
    the player left the ground already at −271 and kept it. **Landing with Back held** is a
    profile of its own: −292 for two loops, then −242 … −223 … −243 for about 25 loops,
    then −271 (alike in *back in air*).
  - *forward after 1* and *forward after 3* (Forward 1 and 3 loops after Jump; the take-off
    is 2 loops after Jump): both approach 340 like the running jump. In `mv_air` Forward
    pressed 8 loops after Jump (6 after the take-off) gave 14.7: a key pressed up to 2
    loops after the take-off counts as held at it, 6 loops after does not.
  - *walk release* (85 units/s): × 0.70–0.77 per loop; *apex release* (340 at the apex):
    × 0.69–0.70 per loop. Early in the rise from run speed the decay is slower (× 0.81–0.845,
    `mv_air`, *repress*). No single rule found; the controller decays with the gain
    (× 0.70), exact at the apex and when slow; a release early in a running jump travels
    about 18 units less than in game [observed difference, not modelled].
  - *fall forward* is not usable (the 150-unit fall ended during the settling loops,
    before the key); *press after landing*: Forward pressed about 5 loops after a standing
    jump's landing: no motion at all for 44 loops (0.7 s), then 339 at once with no
    landing profile [observed, one case; not modelled: the candidate runs at once].
- `mv_diag_fence_edge` (fence top measured to 0.05 afterwards: 3.54 wide at y 4100, faces
  at x −72460.96 and −72457.42, normals 1.7° off x): the player rested on the fence top at
  every offset up to 22.6 beyond the bare edge, fell to the ground at 25.7 and beyond, and
  kept its x within 0–5 units (some outward slides of 4–6). Its rest sank **1.46 units per
  unit off the edge** (onset 1.3 beyond the edge; RMS 1.3 over 14 drops) — more than any
  rounded bottom allows (a sphere touching an edge e off its axis sinks at most e).
- `mv_diag_fence_low`: the same offsets from 50 above the top sank less (1.3, 5.6,
  12.5, 21.5, 26.4 at offsets 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, means of both sides, against 7–13, 15,
  21–26, 23.5, 30–33 from 200 above): **the depth depends on the speed of the fall** (hypothesis I; C refuted).
  From 10 above the centre drop stopped 6.6 above the usual rest (the `SetPos` hang of
  §6.2), so those drops are biased upwards. Two 200-unit repeats: 8399.73 (8400.26 before),
  and 8402.95 at +12 after sliding 6.2 outwards (8408.48 before without sliding). The
  three tree points from 12 and 50 above the earlier rest ended −0.5 … +10.5 from it
  (8643.2 / 8638.1 at the centre against 8638.5, 8636.2 / 8629.6 against 8625.7,
  8702.0 / 8697.3 against 8697.6).

**Model** (`CharacterParams` defaults; `crates/fnv-phys/src/air.rs`, `character.rs`):

- Air: the horizontal velocity closes `AIR_GAIN` 0.30 of the gap to its target per 1/60 s;
  the target is the keys' velocity when a key was held at take-off (or pressed within
  `AIR_FULL_WINDOW`, 4 steps, after leaving the ground, jumping or walking off an edge),
  else the keys' direction at `AIR_CONTROL_SPEED` 14.7; no key: decay with the same gain.
  The take-off starts from the last step's velocity (a jump pressed with the first
  running step starts from 0).
- Landing: after a touchdown faster than 100 units/s (`LANDING_MIN_SPEED` [hypothesis]),
  29 steps follow `LANDING_SPEEDS` (forward or any key not pointing behind the view) or
  `LANDING_SPEEDS_BACK` (a key behind the view, `CharacterInput::view`), in the keys'
  direction, then the keys' velocity. No key, no motion. Walking landings run too
  [observed]. Not modelled: the sideways sway of up to ±30 units/s during the forward
  profile (about 2 units of drift).
- Body: radius 22, cone bottom (flat tip 3.2, slope 1.58: one fit to the 26 fence drops
  from 50 and 200 units, residuals −5 … +5 split by fall speed); off walkable ground the
  vertical motion does not slide; walls keep 0.7.

**Checks** (candidate after these changes; `fnvtool phys cell` on every drop of the four
drop files, 88 drops) [observed]: 71 within 8 units (33 with the old capsule of 18 that
slid off steep contacts). Against the B11 median golden (merged after these
numbers were taken) the scenario passes 17 of 20 (§4.2). `L4.phys.walk.running_jump` 6/6 (it was 0/6); the other walk
scenarios unchanged. Misses: the tree centre rows (below), the 10-unit fence drops (the
hang), two fence drops where the game slid 5–6 units outwards, `collision_marker_b`
(unchanged), `noncollidable_maize` (unchanged; another workstream). The B11 rock rows
pass with this body (the rock investigation belongs to workstream "B11 rocks and maize",
whose rows these numbers only report). One row moved out of tolerance:
`L4.phys.drops.swim_h2o` `shallow_a` (three of its other rows fail for another reason, §6.6)
ends at −246.3 against the game's −236.0 (it was −241.4 with the old capsule, inside the
8-unit tolerance). The drop starts 14 units above a step: the 30-unit riser of the
catwalk stairs 0x030144E3 (top at −240, floor −270) runs about 7 units west of the
player's axis [observed: vertical rays every 2 units; traced to that riser by the swim
workstream]. The game rests at −236.0, 4 above the step top, like the 10-unit fence drops
that also stopped a few units above the usual rest (the `SetPos` hang of §6.2); the
cone, fitted to falls of 50 and 200 units, sinks about 6 below the top, where slow falls
sink least (`mv_diag_fence_low`). Open, with the fall-speed dependence [observed
difference; not tuned].

**Open: the tree centre.** At five tree-a points (the centre, the B11 drop, and three
grid points) the game rests 10–20 units higher than the model at every fall height
(12, 50, 118, 200 and 400 units), held by branches about 22 off the axis that it barely
sinks onto (the branch at 225° from the centre is 0.9 above the rest), while on the fence
an edge 22 off made it sink 30. Our tree collision is one packed triangle mesh (469
vertices, 834 triangles, layer Trees, body translated, not rotated) and the reference's
rotation follows the engine convention (the opposite tilt sign puts the drops 66–193
too high). The fence top is a triangle mesh too, so "mesh against box" does not explain
it. Ideas for a capture: drops onto a single straight branch or a second thin static edge
at several speeds; a drop from below the branches' level (e.g. `SetPos` 5 above a branch
at the rim).

### 6.5 Ladders

New Vegas has no climbable ladders: the only ladder-like uses are door-style transitions
that teleport the player up or down [observed by the owner in game, 2026-10-08]. They are
load doors (or activators with a teleport) and go through the existing door/teleport path
(`Travel`, the arrival rule of §6.2); the controller has no ladder mode.

### 6.6 Swimming

**Water in the data** [observed: the ten masters, read-only, 2026-10-08]. A water surface
belongs to a cell with CELL DATA bit 1 ("has water"): at its XCLW height, or at the
worldspace's default (WRLD DNAM second float) when XCLW is absent or the 3.4e38 sentinel
(world.md §6; the fallback is [hypothesis] there and here). WastelandNV's default is
−2300 (DNAM −2500 land, −2300 water); 44,025 exterior cells of all worldspaces carry the
flag, most with the surface far below their land. In WastelandNV 767 cells have land below
their surface: 421 at −2300 (the Colorado River below Hoover Dam, Cottonwood Cove), 330 at
2600 (Lake Mead: Boulder Beach, Callville Bay, the Fisherman's Shack), Lake Las Vegas
(3000, 4 cells), the Devil's Throat (2290), the Gypsum train yard (4050), Camp Forlorn Hope
(5360) and five single cells (4100 to 7800). Interior cells with the flag and a real XCLW:
47, e.g. `SLGoodspringsCaveINT` (204), `Vault22b` (7320.1), the Old Vegas sewers
(`OVWestSewers01` 5360 …), `NVDLC03SLH2OINT` (−232); others store 14095.9 or heights
above their floors whose meaning is not checked.

Chosen for captures: **Boulder Beach** on Lake Mead, `BoulderBeachCampground`
(WastelandNV (13, 9), surface 2600 in XCLW of the shore cells). From the shore point
(56992, 37536), LAND 12 above the surface, the bed falls east at about 12°: 44 below the
surface 256 units out, 140 at 768, 326 at 1536, about 800 at the deep point (59500, 38500);
`fnvtool phys walk` east from the shore touches only terrain for 1,735 units.

Settings in the masters whose names mention water or swimming [observed: GMST records]:
`fJumpSwimmingMult` 2, `fSwimRadiationDamageMult` 0.1, `fExplosionWaterRadiusRatio` 0.1;
no breath or drowning setting is stored in the masters (any would be an executable
default, not read). Script functions: `IsSwimming`, `IsInDangerousWater` [documented:
script-functions-catalogue.md]; no function to read breath exists without JIP (not
installed).

**Predictions (written 2026-10-08, before the captures `sw_trial` and `sw_fall_breath`,
`tools/capture/jobs/make_swim_jobs.py`).** Game, all [hypothesis], from nothing but a
human of 128 units in water:

- (a) Walking in, `IsSwimming` turns 1 when the feet are about 90 units below the surface
  (water at the chest, 0.7 of the capsule) and the feet stop following the bed; walking
  out it turns 0 at the same depth (no hysteresis).
- (b) Floating, the feet stay about 90 below the surface (eye just above it), within a
  unit, no bobbing.
- (c) Swimming is slower than running: forward about 100–150 units/s with Always Run, the
  Run key (walk) slower, backwards slower than forwards, sideways like forwards.
- (d) Forward with the view pitched moves along the view (vertical speed = speed ×
  sin(pitch)); pitch alone does nothing; released under water the player rises back to
  the floating height; the Jump key at the surface does nothing or a small jump
  (`fJumpSwimmingMult` 2 suggests a multiplier for jumping out of water).
- (e) A fall into deep water stops in the water with no damage; the same falls onto land
  cost health from 700 units up.
- (f) Held under water with god mode off, health starts falling after some tens of
  seconds (drowning).

Candidate before this work (`fnv-phys` ignores layer 11 Water and has no water volumes):
walking in, the character keeps walking along the bed and ends 780 loops later at about
2380 (`phys walk` above: z falls 2617 → 2233 over 20.5 s); it never swims, floats or
dives,
and a fall into the lake ends on the bed.

**Captures** (unattended, save `nvfdoc`, out of Doc Mitchell's house, `coc
BoulderBeachCampground`, god mode and AI detection off; outputs kept privately in
`C:\fnv-private\capture\swim\`). Method facts [observed]: a script variable named `fW` does
not compile (`fSw` does); arriving at the beach (by `coc` or by `SetPos` from Goodsprings)
leaves `MenuMode` 1 with the game clock stopped until the console's `CloseAllMenus`
(`sw_diag`, `sw_diag2`); a first `sw_trial` run from `nvftest` recorded nothing for that
reason. `IsSwimming` compiles and reads **0 throughout**, also while the player floats and
swims (so the swimming state is read from positions, not from it); `IsInDangerousWater`
0; `GetAV Rads` does not compile.

`sw_trial` (2026-10-08, 8,352 steps) [observed]; S = the surface, 2600; depths are of the
feet below S; speeds are linear fits over the held windows with each position paired with
the previous loop's clock (§6.3):

- **Walking in, the player never swims.** Walking (84.7 units/s) and running (334.9 along
  the ground) east down the 12° bed it kept walking on the bed to 213 and 353 below S, and
  stood there (head far under water). (a) as predicted is refuted: being on the ground
  wins over the water.
- **Entering by falling.** `SetPos` to S over 800 units of water from the land: free fall
  (accelerating like gravity) until the feet passed S − 100 (the last loop above had them
  94.5 below, the first one below 100.2), then the fall stopped at once and the player sank
  slowly to **S − 102.52** and stayed there (b: the floating height; predicted about 90).
- **Sinking to the floating height**: 12.0–12.5 units/s (fits over 13 placements at S while
  already swimming; `SetPos` keeps the swimming state, so a placement above the floating
  height sank at this speed instead of falling).
- **Swim speeds** (c): forward 352.2, backward 343.3, right 341.1, left 341.5, forward-right
  346.1, forward with the Sneak control tapped 351.6 (`IsSneaking` stayed 0: no sneaking in
  water), along the view while diving 351.2–351.7; walking (Run key held) 100.8. So the
  run speed (344 on land) in every direction, backward included (0.79 on land), and walking
  16% faster than on land (86.8).
- **Diving** (d): forward moves along the view: pitch 30° down 304.4 horizontal / 176.0
  down, 60° 175.8 / 304.6, 89° 6.1 / 351.1 (tan of the ratios 30.0°, 60.0°, 89.0°). The view
  pitched with no key: no motion (still sinking at 12.2 to the floating height). Released
  under water the player **stays at its depth** (5 s, z unchanged to 0.01): no buoyancy.
  Swimming up at 45° (240 up, 240 forward) stops at the floating band: once the feet were
  above S − 100 the upward motion stopped and the 12-units/s sink took over, so the feet
  went up and down between S − 97.5 and S − 102.5 while forward was held. Back on the bed
  (89° down) the player stayed on it.
- **Leaving the water**: swimming (sinking towards the floating height) towards the shore
  until the feet reached the bed's contact shell (4.3 above LAND), then walking up the bed
  at the ground speed.
- **Jump** (d): Jump tapped while sinking towards the floating height (61 below S): a
  ballistic jump of apex **124.2** above the take-off (2 × 61.6 = 123.2: the land jump
  height × `fJumpSwimmingMult` 2) under gravity. Afterwards the player hung in the air
  4.75 above S for the rest of the run (positions frozen while the clock ran, through
  further `SetPos`; like the hanging after `SetPos` drops of §6.2): the later jump and
  sneak-key tests are not usable.

**Predictions for `sw_fall_breath`** (written before its run, 2026-10-08; jump from the
floating height, falls of 300, 700, 1500 and 3000 units into the lake and onto the land
west of the beach with god mode off and Health raised by 5,000, two minutes held at the
bottom): from `sw_trial`, a fall into the water stops at S − 100 and the player then
sinks at 12 units/s to S − 102.5, losing no health at any height [hypothesis]; the land
falls lose health from 700 up (`fJumpFallHeightMin` 600) [hypothesis]; the jump from the
floating height rises 123 [hypothesis]; health falls while held under water after some
seconds [hypothesis].

`sw_fall_breath` (2026-10-08) [observed]; it ended at its last land fall (3000 units:
Health 3094.7 → −6324.9, the player died, the game reloaded the save and the plugin aborted
the job each time until the run was stopped), so the part under water was not reached:

- **Jump at the floating height**: Jump tapped twice with the feet settled at S − 102.5:
  no motion at all (4 s each). With `sw_trial`'s jump (taken while still sinking 61 below
  S) the jump works only above the floating height.
- **Entering from a fall** (`SetPos` from the land to S, standing start, then 300, 700,
  1500, 3000 above S): the fall stopped with the feet 100.0 below S (from S: the step that
  crossed ended at 2500.00 exactly, then the 12-units/s sink to S − 102.5), 105.97 (300),
  114.79 (700), 123.75 (1500) and 149.41 (3000) below S; after the stop the player stayed at
  that depth (below the floating height: no rise). Falling at 340–2,030 units/s the last
  steps before the stop were 5.3–33 units; at 1500 and 3000 the player moved one more
  loop's step after the loop that crossed S − 100 (at 700 it did not), so the stop is not a
  clamp at the line; which loop the game decides on is open.
- **No fall damage in water** (e): Health unchanged (5200) after every fall into the lake.
  On land: 300 → none; 700 → −46.7; 1500 → −1858.6; 3000 → −9419.6 (dead). With h the
  height fallen (start feet to landing feet: 695.6, 1495.4, 2995.3) the damage fits
  k·(h − 600)^1.65 with k ≈ 0.0252 within 0.8% (exponent from the three falls 1.647 and
  1.649): `fJumpFallHeightMin` 600 and `fJumpFallHeightExponent` 1.65 [the link to the
  settings is a hypothesis]. Two later drops of 40 Health each, 1–3 s after the 700 and
  1500 landings (once with the player pushed 130 units sideways), are not explained.

**Predictions for `sw_breath`** (written before its run): two minutes pressed against the
bed 800 below S with god mode off: Health drops after a breath time of some tens of seconds
and then keeps dropping [hypothesis]; the 700 fall stops 100–117 below S [hypothesis: one
step of 16.5 past the line at most, by the controller's rule below].

`sw_breath` (2026-10-08) [observed]:

- **Drowning** (f): the player dived (89° down, forward held) to the bed 800 below S
  within 2.2 s and was held against it. Health (5200 after `ModAV Health 5000`, god mode
  off) stayed at 5200 for **10.0 s** after the dive started (the head was under water
  within a tenth of a second: the eye is about 123 above the feet, §6.3, and the feet
  started at S − 102.5), then fell linearly at **40.0 Health per second** (fit over 100 s,
  39.97) to 1.17, then 0.57, when the player shot 60 units up and rose at about 100
  units/s (dead, [hypothesis]). Whether the 10 s and the 40 per second depend on the
  character (Endurance, level, the 200 base Health) is not known (one character).
  Released at the bed after 128 s the player stayed there (no rise) while drowning.
- The 700-unit fall into the water stopped at exactly the same place as in
  `sw_fall_breath` (2485.21, 114.79 below S; same last steps 2518.52, 2501.86, 2485.21).

**The swim rules in `fnv-phys`** (`CharacterParams::swim_depth` 100, `float_depth` 102.5,
`swim_sink_speed` 12.1, `swim_jump_mult` 2; `crates/fnv-phys/src/character.rs`,
`swim_vertical`; water areas `crates/fnv-phys/src/water.rs`). Water is a flat surface over
each loaded exterior cell's square with `Cell::water_surface` (CELL XCLW, else the
worldspace default, for cells flagged "has water": the renderer's rule), plus the box of
each placed water reference (below); no collider. (Interiors first used their XCLW too;
`sw_h2o` refuted that, below.) A character **starts swimming** after a step that ends with it off
the ground, falling, with its feet `swim_depth` or more below the surface: its fall stops
there, with no landing (so no fall damage) [observed]; the stop is after that step, not
clamped to the line (the game's extra step at high speed, above, is not modelled). While
swimming there is no gravity; the caller's horizontal velocity applies and its
`vertical` velocity (forward speed × sine of the view pitch in `nvf-play`) applies when
diving, and when rising only from the floating height or deeper; above the floating
height the character otherwise sinks at 12.1 units/s and stops at it; below it nothing
moves it vertically (no buoyancy) [all observed]. Jump works only above the floating
height and gives a jump of `swim_jump_mult` × `jump_height` that leaves the water
[observed: the two cases above]. Swimming **ends** when the swimmer moves down onto
walkable ground (it then walks) [observed: leaving the lake], when it jumps, or where there
is no water at all [hypothesis]; feet above the surface do not end it [observed:
`swim_h2o_drops`, below; the first implementation ended it there]. A character on the ground never starts swimming,
however deep [observed: walking in]. The swimming state survives `place_character`, as
the game's does across `SetPos` [observed]. Walking speeds are the caller's: `nvf-play`
swims at 348 (Always Run) and 100.8 (walk) in every direction, along the view
(`SWIM_SPEEDS`, `swim_velocity`) [observed: fits 341–352; walking 100.8]. Not modelled:
breath and drowning damage (no health in the controller), the hanging after the jump in
`sw_trial`, swimming state reported to scripts (`IsSwimming` reads 0 in the game).

`fnvtool phys walk` scripts take `swim_velocity` ([x, y, z], used instead of `velocity`
while the character swims) per segment and the swim parameters in `params`; traces and
observations report `swimming`, `phys cell`/`walk` documents list `water` (§7).

**Held-out scenarios** (designed after the Boulder Beach captures, at two other waters;
inputs `parity-lab/inputs/layer4/swim_*.walk.json`, job `sw_scenarios` made by
`make_swim_jobs.py` through `capture_moves.py` with the new `reset_at` and `pitch_deg`
capture fields; the player first stands on land near the water, so it is not swimming
when placed at the surface). **Predictions of the candidate** (written 2026-10-08, before
the capture), feet (x, y, z):

- `swim_cove_dive` (Cottonwood Cove, surface −2300 from the worldspace default; start
  [70200, −91264, −2300], heading 0, pitch 40° down, forward held): t0.25 (70200.0,
  −91197.3, −2458.4); t0.50 (70200.0, −91130.6, −2514.3); t0.75 (70200.0, −91064.0,
  −2570.3); t1.00 (70200.0, −90997.3, −2626.2); t1.25 (70200.0, −90930.6, −2682.1); t1.50
  (70200.0, −90863.9, −2738.0). Before the keys: floating at −2402.5.
- `swim_lake_shore` (Lake Las Vegas, XCLW 3000; start [25784, 55100, 3000], heading 270,
  forward held): t0.25 (25697.0, 55100.0, 2897.5); t0.50 (25610.0, 55100.0, 2897.5); t0.75
  (25523.0, 55100.0, 2897.5); t1.00 (25436.0, 55100.0, 2897.5); t1.25 (25348.9, 55100.0,
  2897.5); t1.50 (25261.9, 55100.0, 2897.5, walking from here); t1.75 (25185.6, 55099.7,
  2932.9); t2.00 (25109.8, 55099.4, 2970.7).

Watch: whether the Cottonwood Cove water is at −2300 (the worldspace-default
[hypothesis]); the swim speed 348 against the run's 344 (the onset alignment); where the
swimmer meets the shore and how fast it walks up a 27° bank out of water.

**Held-out results** (`sw_scenarios`, 2026-10-08; goldens `phys/swim_cove_dive.walk.json`,
`phys/swim_lake_shore.walk.json`) [observed]:

- Cottonwood Cove floats at −2402.52: the surface there is the worldspace default −2300
  (the fallback of `Cell::water_surface` is confirmed for one place). The dive followed
  the view at 40°. Lake Las Vegas floated at 2895.22 (104.78 below 3000; the entry from a
  standing start overshot the floating height there).
- Against the predictions: `swim_cove_dive` within 1.4 at t0.25 and t0.50 and 9.2 at t0.75,
  then up to 27 in y and 23 in z off (lab 3/6); `swim_lake_shore` within 2.3 to t0.50, then
  up to 35 off, and the exit differs (lab 3/8). **Refuted: the constant swim speed.** The game's speed varies with time
  since the motion started, the same way in both captures and in every forward run of
  `sw_trial` once looked at in sixteenths of a second: 339 units/s for 6/16 s, then a cycle
  of 23/16 s rising to 412 and falling to 160 whose mean is 339.1; backward and sideways
  runs have flatter cycles (313–370–284 and 288–379) of the same period and mean
  (`sw_trial`: back, right, left, forward-right and sneak-forward runs; the walk at 86
  units/s varies too, 82–122 over 2 s, no full cycle seen). The constant 348 of the first
  implementation was a 2-s average over part of a cycle. The candidate now models the
  cycle (`fnv_phys::swim`, tables from `sw_trial` only: forward = mean of the four forward
  and diving runs, backward and sideways from their runs; walking constant at 86
  [hypothesis]); `fnvtool phys walk` applies it to a segment's `swim_velocity` with
  `"stroke": "forward" | "back" | "side"`, and `nvf-play` from the keys. The two scenario
  inputs above were left as they were (constant 348, no stroke): they keep failing.
- **Refuted / open: leaving the water up a steep bank.** At Lake Las Vegas (bank about 27°)
  the swimmer never walked: it kept the swimming state, its z stayed at the floating
  height (then sank at 12 units/s) while it moved into the bank until its feet were 22–31
  below the LAND surface under them, then rose about 30 in one loop to the surface, and
  repeated (six steps up), ending 74 above the water surface still sinking at 12 units/s
  and blocked. At Boulder Beach (12°) the swimmer walked out. The candidate, which lets a
  swimmer that reaches walkable ground walk, walked up the 27° bank. Not modelled (one
  capture; the feet 30 under the terrain suggest a different collision shape while
  swimming [hypothesis]).

**Predictions for the second held-out set** (written 2026-10-08 before `sw_heldout2` and
`sw_h2o`; candidate with the stroke cycle), feet (x, y, z):

- `swim_dam_forward` (Lake Mead above Hoover Dam, XCLW 2600; start [77696, 33024, 2600],
  north, forward held, stroke forward): t0.25 (77696.0, 33108.7, 2497.5); t0.50 (77696.0,
  33195.1, 2497.5); t0.75 (77696.0, 33294.4, 2497.5); t1.00 (77696.0, 33396.8, 2497.5);
  t1.25 (77696.0, 33492.3, 2497.5); t1.50 (77696.0, 33571.1, 2497.5); t1.75 (77696.0,
  33624.0, 2497.5); t2.00 (77696.0, 33706.6, 2497.5); t2.25 (77696.0, 33807.6, 2497.5); t2.50
  (77696.0, 33909.2, 2497.5).
- `swim_bay_back` (Lake Mead off Callville Bay, XCLW 2600; start [50560, 62720, 2600],
  facing north, Back held, stroke back): t0.25 (50560.0, 62635.3, 2497.5); t0.50 (50560.0,
  62554.1, 2497.5); t0.75 (50560.0, 62469.1, 2497.5); t1.00 (50560.0, 62379.1, 2497.5); t1.25
  (50560.0, 62287.3, 2497.5); t1.50 (50560.0, 62200.3, 2497.5); t1.75 (50560.0, 62125.1,
  2497.5); t2.00 (50560.0, 62044.5, 2497.5).
- `swim_h2o_drops` (interior NVDLC03SLH2OINT, XCLW −232; drops at −227): deep_a (−300,
  −1000), deep_b (−300, −800), mid_a (−500, −200), mid_b (−700, −200) all floating at
  −334.5 (the floors are 456, 496, 136 and 136 below the surface); shallow_a (−1098.0,
  −550.0, −242.0), standing on the floor 38 below the surface (−270 + its shell).

**Results of the second held-out set** (`sw_heldout2`, `sw_h2o`, 2026-10-08; goldens
`phys/swim_dam_forward.walk.json`, `phys/swim_bay_back.walk.json`,
`phys/swim_h2o_drops.drops.json`) [observed]:

- `swim_dam_forward`: 10/10 within 2.6 units (the game floated at 2494.9, 105.1 below the
  surface, as at Lake Las Vegas: the standing-start entry overshot the floating height);
  `swim_bay_back`: 8/8 within 2.8. The stroke cycle (forward and backward tables from
  `sw_trial`) holds at two other places.
- `swim_h2o_drops` **refutes interior water at XCLW**: dropped 5 above the interior's XCLW
  (−232) the player fell freely through it and stopped at −432.36 (deep_a, then stayed);
  placed again at −227 while swimming it sank at 12 units/s through −289 and −350 (deep_b,
  mid_a, mid_b, still sinking after 10 s). That fits a surface near −330: the cell holds a
  placeable water reference, `NVDLC03CleanWater2048x2048` (PWAT 0x03014467, model
  `water_placeable\waterp2048x2048.nif`, scale 2) at z −328, centred at (−584, −656), whose
  floating height would be −430.5. shallow_a ended at −236.04, 34 above the floor our
  collision has there (−270), not explained. The interior part of the swim implementation
  (water at an interior's XCLW) is **reverted**: interiors have no water in `fnv-phys`
  until placed water is modelled (its extent from the model, its height from the
  reference: [hypothesis], one interior). Exterior cell water is unaffected (four places
  agree). The renderer still draws interior water planes at XCLW (Layer 3, unchanged).

**Should `phys walk` apply the stroke cycle by default?** (decision 2026-10-08) No: a
segment swims at its `swim_velocity` unless it names a `stroke`. The game's speed follows a
stroke whenever a movement key is held [observed: every run], but (1) which stroke depends
on the key (forward, back, sideways cycles differ), and a segment's velocity does not say
which key the game held; (2) the cycle is a fraction of the game's 339, so applied to a
segment's own speed it reproduces the game only when that speed is 339; the two old
inputs ask for 348 (the 2-s average of the first implementation), and treating
`swim_velocity` as a direction only would make an explicit number meaningless (and the
walking swim, 86, has no cycle [hypothesis]). So `swim_cove_dive` and `swim_lake_shore`
cannot express what the game does; with the inputs unchanged they keep failing. Checked
with scratch copies of the inputs (not in the lab): `"stroke": "forward"` at 339 along the
same directions brings `swim_cove_dive` to 6/6 (within 2.1 units; **the dive's 23–27-unit
drift from t0.75 is the stroke cycle**: at t1.00–t1.50 the game is past the stroke's peak
of 412 units/s) and `swim_lake_shore` to 5/8 before the bank (within 2.3); the stroke at 348
drifts by 2.7 % (9.3 units at t1.50 of the dive). Question for the owner: retire the two
scenarios and replace them with inputs that name the stroke at 339 (and, for the shore, a
capture with the cell loaded; below)?

**Retired and redesigned (owner decision 2026-10-09).** `L4.phys.walk.swim_cove_dive` and
`.swim_lake_shore` are retired (their inputs removed; the goldens stay private and unused):
their inputs ask for a constant 348 units/s that the game never swims, and the shore's bank
rows were captured with the cell not loaded. Replacements, at places no capture has used,
with the forward stroke at 339 and each capture loading its cell with `cow` first (job
`sw_redesign`, `make_swim_jobs.py` `redesign()`):

- `L4.phys.walk.swim_cove_stroke`: Cottonwood Cove (surface −2300) from (70250, −90750),
  heading 45°, view 30° down, forward held 2 s over 604–625 units of water (terrain only).
- `L4.phys.walk.swim_lake_exit`: Lake Las Vegas (3000) from (29875, 56623), heading 132.3°,
  level, forward held 2.5 s to the 24.1° bank of cell (7, 13) and up it (terrain only).

**Predictions of the candidate** (written 2026-10-09 before the capture), feet (x, y, z):

- `swim_cove_stroke`: t0.25 (70301.9, −90698.1, −2444.9); t0.50 (70354.8, −90645.2, −2488.1);
  t0.75 (70415.6, −90584.4, −2537.7); t1.00 (70478.3, −90521.7, −2588.9); t1.25 (70536.8,
  −90463.2, −2636.7); t1.50 (70585.1, −90414.9, −2676.1); t1.75 (70617.5, −90382.5, −2702.5);
  t2.00 (70668.0, −90332.0, −2743.8).
- `swim_lake_exit`: t0.25 (29937.7, 56566.0, 2897.5); t0.50 (30001.6, 56507.9, 2897.5); t0.75
  (30075.1, 56441.0, 2897.5); t1.00 (30150.8, 56372.1, 2897.5); t1.25 (30220.9, 56308.4,
  2900.9, walking); t1.50 (30279.0, 56255.4, 2935.6); t1.75 (30337.2, 56202.4, 2970.4); t2.00
  (30396.1, 56148.8, 3002.6); t2.25 (30452.0, 56098.0, 3043.9); t2.50 (30508.9, 56046.2,
  3081.3).

Watch: the floating height after a standing-start entry (102.5–105.1 below in earlier
captures; the candidate 102.5), and the walk up the 24° bank (the candidate climbed the
steeper banks of `sw_banks*` faster than the game).

**Results** (`sw_redesign`, 2026-10-09; goldens `phys/swim_cove_stroke.walk.json`,
`phys/swim_lake_exit.walk.json`; MenuMode 0 and the clock running throughout) [observed]:
`swim_cove_stroke` 8/8: x and y within 1.2 at every row; z 3.5–4.5 lower in the game, which
floated at −2405.98 (106.0 below the surface, the entry overshoot) where the candidate
floats at 102.5. `swim_lake_exit` 10/10: within 1.4 while swimming (to t1.25, when both
reach the bed); walking up the 24° bank the candidate moves ahead, 3.6 at t1.50 growing to
9.7 at t2.50 (inside the tolerance of 10; the faster climb on slopes seen in `sw_banks*`,
a land-controller question). The stroke cycle at 339 and the exit onto the bank hold at
two more places.

**Leaving the water: what the two shores show** (re-read of `sw_scenarios` and `sw_trial`
against the LAND under each sample, `fnvtool phys cell` rays with and without meshes,
2026-10-08) [observed]:

- At Lake Las Vegas the swimmer met no LAND at all. Floating at 2895.22 it moved west at
  the stroke speed into the 27.3° bank with z unchanged, so its feet went 0 → 29.3 below
  the LAND under them over ten loops; in the next loop z rose 30.5 and the feet were
  **exactly on the LAND surface** (0.01 above it, no contact shell); then the same again:
  the depth before each rise was 28.3–30.6 and after it 0.01, 0.02, 1.1, 2.5, 2.8 and 0.7
  below the LAND, six times, with the 12-units/s sink between rises and the horizontal
  speed unchanged throughout (5.5–6.6 units per loop). It ended blocked by the rock
  references at the top of the bank (layer Terrain), 7.6 below the LAND under it.
- At Boulder Beach the swimmer collided with the LAND as a walking capsule does: floating
  at S − 102.49 and walking towards a 33.9° slope, z stayed level until the LAND under the
  feet was 7.7 below them, then the feet rose with the bed 4.4–4.8 above it (walking); the
  run-out line, swum while still sinking, met 28° and rose 4.3 above the LAND. So the
  slopes at the two places are alike (the run-out line's 28–34° is not the 12° average of
  the walk-in line) and the bank angle does not explain the difference.
- That after each rise the feet are on the bare surface, not on its 3.5 shell, points to a
  placement from the LAND heights (or a ray), not to the swept capsule [hypothesis].

Candidate explanations [hypothesis]: (P) the place: the swimmer's capsule does not collide
with the LAND at Lake Las Vegas (why is open), and something puts the feet back on the LAND
surface when they are about 30 below it; (S) the state: the Lake Las Vegas swimmer had
overshot to 104.78 below the surface while the Boulder Beach one floated at 102.49, or ran
where the other walked, and that changes its collision.

**Predictions for `sw_banks`** (written 2026-10-08 before its run; job
`tools/capture/jobs/make_swim_jobs.py` `banks()`). Each trial stands on land, is put at the
surface 450 units out from where the bed reaches the floating height (enters by falling),
floats for 5 s and then holds forward (Always Run; one trial walks) up the bank for 4 s
(8 s walking). Banks of terrain only, found from the LAND heights: Lake Mead (S 2600) at
12.5°, 16.4°, 25.3°, 30.4°, 41.5°, 45.1°, 49.3° and 58.3°; Lake Las Vegas (S 3000) at 14.3°
and 24.7°; and the two lines above again (Lake Las Vegas running and walking, Boulder
Beach running from the floating height). The game, from (P): every Lake Las Vegas trial
shows the saw-tooth (feet into the LAND by about 30, then on its surface) whatever the
slope and speed; every Lake Mead trial meets the bed with its capsule, walks out up to
the steepest walkable slope (45° in the candidate, itself [hypothesis], §6.3) and stays
in the water below steeper banks. From (S): a trial that floats 102.5 below the surface
walks out wherever the slope allows, at either lake. The candidate (stroke cycle forward,
walking 86; feet when swimming ends, seconds after the keys, and after 4 s):

| `lm_45` | 2497.5 | (73210.5, 43005.3, 2497.5), 1.18 s | (73328.8, 43001.9, 2574.0), stopped on the slope |
| `lm_49` | 2497.5 | (126474.7, 101636.6, 2497.5), 1.17 s | (126336.5, 101799.5, 2498.2), at the foot of the bank |

(The candidate ends swimming on any ground it is pushed onto, walkable or not, and then
stands at the foot of the 49° and 58° banks.)

**`sw_banks` results: the Lake Las Vegas saw-tooth was a capture artefact** (2026-10-08)
[observed]. The first run travelled between the banks by long `SetPos` moves only: the
owner saw the land drawn as distant LOD around the player (the full cells not loaded),
three trials froze (positions and clock still) and the game crashed. `sw_scenarios` had
reached Lake Las Vegas the same way (a `SetPos` from Goodsprings), so its swimmer met a bank
without terrain collision; what lifted it onto the bare LAND surface every ~30 units is
whatever the game does for an actor below an unloaded landscape (not studied). The job
now loads each bank's own cell with the console's `cow WastelandNV <x> <y>` before short
`SetPos` moves (`bank_trial`). In the second run the game lost the focus to another
program's window after four trials and hung (the owner: other sessions' engine runs take
the focus; Fallout stops running in the background); those four trials, compared with the
candidate at equal times after the motion onset (the game ran at about 50 loops per
second, so sample counts are not times):

| Trial | Feet − LAND, lowest | Game leaves the water | Candidate − game (x, y, z) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llv_line` (27°, running) | +4.15 | at the bank, 1.5 s | within 5 except t2.0–2.5 (−20, +1, +11: meeting the bank); t4.0 (+5, −7, +2) |
| `llv_line walk` | +4.39 | 6.1 s | swimming ±21 along the line (the walking stroke varies 82–122, the candidate holds 86 [hypothesis]); walking within 8 |
| `bb_line` (28–34°, running from the float) | +4.05 | at once | walking up: the candidate up to 17 ahead and 12 higher by t4.0 (land walking up slope, not swimming) |
| `lm_12` (12.5°) | +3.95 | 1.2 s | within 3 to t2.0 (frozen from 2.3 s, the focus loss) |

So, with its cell loaded, the game's swimmer meets a 12–34° bank with its capsule (never
below the LAND's contact shell) and walks out, as the candidate does; the "different
shape while swimming" [hypothesis] is withdrawn.

The other banks (`sw_banks_b`, `sw_banks_c`, same job per trial; in `sw_banks_b` the game
clock stopped while five trials waited in the water although MenuMode read 0 after the
travel, so `sw_banks_c` closes menus again just before the keys and reran those five
[observed: MenuMode 0 there, every trial ran]; why the clock stopped is not known, a
level-up menu after discovering map markers is [hypothesis]):

| Bank | Game | Candidate − game while swimming / after |
|---|---|---|
| `lm_16` (16.4°) | walks out at 1.2 s | within 2 / within 9 to t3.5 |
| `lm_25` (25.3°) | walks out | within 2 / within 10 |
| `lm_30` (30.4°) | walks out | within 2 / within 10 to t3.0 |
| `lm_41` (41.5°) | walks out up the 41.5° bank | within 2 / the candidate 16 ahead and 16 higher from t2.0 (faster up the steep slope) |
| `lm_45` (45.1°) | walks up the bank's 105 units of 45.4° (z +107 in 0.75 s) to the cliff above it, then edges along its foot | within 2 / the candidate stops 35–46 lower (its 45° limit) |
| `lm_49` (49.3°) | stands at the bank's foot (4.4 above the floating height) and drifts sideways along it, 75 units in 3 s | within 2 / z within 4; the candidate drifts sideways faster (+62 at t3.5) |
| `lm_58` (58.3°) | stands at the foot, creeps 1 unit | within 2 / within 10 |
| `llv_14` (14.3°), `llv_25` (24.7°) | walk out | within 2 / within 14 |

So the swimming part and the moment of leaving the water agree at every bank, and the game
leaves the water exactly where the candidate does: moving onto ground ends swimming
[observed]. **The steepest walkable slope lies between 45.1° and 49.3°** [observed: walked
up 45.1–45.4°, stood below 49.3° and 58.3°]; the candidate's 45° (§6, a [hypothesis]) is
inside that range only just, and the 41.5° and 45.1° banks also show the candidate climbing
steep slopes faster than the game. Both are land-controller questions (§6.3, the slope
limit and the speed along steep slopes) and are left to that work; nothing here changes
the swim rules.

**Placed water** (2026-10-08) [observed: the masters and `Fallout - Meshes.bsa`, read-only].
The reference in `NVDLC03SLH2OINT` is REFR 0x03014467, base PWAT 0x03014465
(`NVDLC03CleanWater2048x2048`: OBND ±1024 × ±1024 × 0, MODL
`Water_Placeable\WaterP2048x2048.NIF`, DNAM 8 bytes whose second u32 is the WATR
0x0301454D `NVDLC03CleanWater`), scale 2, no rotation, at (−584, −656, −328). The model
holds a 2048 × 2048 quad at z 0 (the visible surface) and a `bhkSimpleShapePhantom` on
Havok layer 11 (Water) whose shape is a box of half extents (146.3, 146.3, 73.2) Havok units
moved down by 73.2: in game units (× 7) the column under the quad, 2048 × 2048 and 1024
deep, its top at the quad. All eight placeable water models (the 11 PWAT bases of the ten
masters use them) hold the same: a Water-layer phantom box under the quad, top at the quad
(1024 deep, the bathtub's 13; `WaterPCircle512` has another shape type under its phantom).
No other mesh of the game's archives has a Water-layer phantom (the 40 phantoms of all
archives: triggers, traps, the water models). 86 PWAT references stand in interiors, some
with an XCLW, some without.

Model [hypothesis: the phantom box is the water, its top the surface]: a reference whose
model holds Water-layer phantoms is water inside each phantom's box, transformed by the
reference (`fnv_phys::PlacedWater`; `fnv_collide::nif::collision_and_phantoms` reads the
phantoms, which never collide); the surface is the box's top. A reference's water goes with the reference (`PhysWorld::remove_ref`) but not with a re-add of its bodies (`add_ref`), so water and solid collision can be added in either order; no model of the game has both [observed 2026-10-09: the eight Water-layer phantom models have no rigid body; the other 32 phantom meshes are on layers 12 and 24]. For `NVDLC03SLH2OINT`: surface
−328, footprint x −2632…1464, y −2704…1392, bottom −2376. Checked against `swim_h2o_drops`
[observed]: deep_a now stops at −433.2 (game −432.36); with the swimming state carried
from one drop to the next as the capture did (a walk script whose segments start with
`place`), deep_b, mid_a and mid_b sink from −227 at 12 units/s to −287.5 after 5 s and
−348.0 after 10 s (game −289.0/−349.6, −290.1/−350.7, −289.3/−349.9). So the golden is
consistent with water at −328 *and* with the swimming state surviving 101 units above
the surface; the lab's drops are fresh probes and cannot carry that state, so those three
rows keep failing (the scenario's design, not the golden; question for the owner below).
shallow_a: the drop point is 10 units from the 30-unit riser of the catwalk stairs
0x030144E3 (steps at −240 and −270); the game stood at −236.04, 4 above the upper step,
the candidate on the step's edge at −241.3 with the capsule (within the scenario's 8) and
−246.3 with the cone-bottomed body of §6.4.1 (outside it); not a water question (§6.4.1).
**Refuted: "swimming ends when the feet are above the surface"** (the first
implementation's [hypothesis]): the h2o player swam 101 units above the placed surface,
and the Lake Las Vegas one 74 above the lake [observed]. Swimming now ends only on ground,
on a jump, or where there is no water at all [the last: hypothesis].

**`swim_h2o` retired and redesigned (owner decision 2026-10-09).** `L4.phys.drops.swim_h2o`
is retired (input removed, golden kept unused): its capture placed the player while it still
swam from the previous drop, which the candidate's fresh probes cannot reproduce. Its
replacement `L4.phys.drops.swim_h2o_fresh` (job `sw_h2o_fresh`, a fresh `coc` before every
drop, as `sw_guardian`) keeps the five points at −227 and adds two over floors past the
swimming depth (122.5 and 130.4 below the placed surface) and two short of it (75.3 and 78.9
below). **Predictions of the candidate** (written 2026-10-09 before the capture), feet z:
deep_a −433.2 and deep_b −433.2 (swimming; the fall stops past S − 100 at about S − 105);
mid_a −366.6 and mid_b −366.6 (standing on floors 40 below the surface); shallow_a −246.3 (the
stair edge, §6.4.1); past_depth_a −433.2 and past_depth_b −433.2 (swimming, 17 and 25 above
their floors); short_depth_a −402.2 and short_depth_b −405.7 (standing in water, on floors
75–79 below the surface).

**`sw_h2o_fresh` results** (2026-10-09; golden `phys/swim_h2o_fresh.drops.json`; MenuMode 0
before every drop) [observed]: deep_a −432.36, deep_b −432.87, past_depth_a −432.87,
past_depth_b −435.40 (swimming; within 2.2 of the candidate), mid_a and mid_b −366.45 (on
their floors, 40 below the surface; within 0.2), short_depth_a −402.29 and short_depth_b
−405.81 (on their floors 75–79 below the surface, not swimming; within 0.1): lab 8/9. So the
game's swimming depth lies between 79 and 122 below the surface (the candidate's 100 is
inside), and a fresh drop into placed water stops 104.4–107.4 below its surface.
shallow_a, beside the stair riser: −238.07 in this fresh drop (−236.04 when the old
capture's swimmer sank onto it at 12 units/s); the candidate −246.3 with the cone-bottomed
body, 8.2 off (tolerance 8). A step-edge question with a fall-speed dependence (§6.4.1),
not water.

**Predictions for `sw_guardian`** (held-out scenario `L4.phys.drops.swim_guardian`,
input `parity-lab/inputs/layer4/swim_guardian_drops.drops.json`; written 2026-10-08 before
the run). `CampGuardianCaves` holds `NVCleanWater2048x2048` (0x0013F31A) at scale 3 and
z 6528 (footprint y −8704…−2560) while its XCLW is 6712. Drops 5 above the placed surface,
each after a fresh `coc` (not swimming): inside the box `in_deep` (−4900, −8450), `in_edge`
(−4800, −8650), `in_north` (−5250, −7800) → swimming, stopped at 6425.5 (the fall stops
one step past S − 100); just outside its south edge `out_near` (−4800, −8760), `out_mid`
(−4800, −8800), `out_far` (−4850, −8850) → no water, standing on the floor at 6206.0,
6224.9, 6256.1. If the cell's XCLW were the water, every drop would stop at once (the
drop height is already 179 below 6712); if the water reached past the box, the `out_*`
drops would swim at about 6425.

**`sw_guardian` results** (2026-10-08; golden `phys/swim_guardian_drops.drops.json`)
[observed]: in_deep 6420.82, in_edge 6425.52, in_north 6421.33 (swimming: stopped 102.5–107.2
below the placed surface), out_near 6206.29, out_mid 6221.17, out_far 6260.48 (on the floor):
every z within 4.7 of the prediction. The water is the placed reference's box, not the
cell's XCLW (6712), and it ends at the box's edge (54 units inside: swimming; 56 outside:
on the floor). The lab gave 5/6 with the capsule (`out_far` landed on a sloping floor and
slid 10.4 units in y where the game stayed: a landing question, not water) and gives 6/6
with the cone-bottomed body of §6.4.1.

### 6.7 Interior starts and falls: safe spots (`engine/nvf-play`, `player/safe.rs`)

Problem [observed 2026-10-08, `nvforever --play --cell GSGasStation`]: Ringo's cash box
0x001629C0 (CaravanCashRingo, at 681.9, −4815.7, 7552.3) stands outside the gas station's
room (the game reaches it through barter). A start 60 units beside it (`--pos
681.9,-4755,7552.3 --eye-height 112`) found nothing below and fell for ever (feet 7552 →
−9152 in 8 s); a start on it stood on the box's top (its collision, layer 10, z 7587.7)
and walking off fell for ever. Interiors have no terrain, so the exterior rule (1,000
units under the terrain) never caught it.

What the data offers: **XTEL** gives each door's destination (door, position, rotation)
[documented: xEdit; simulation.md §5]; a door teleports its activator to that position
in the destination door's cell [hypothesis for the default activation, simulation.md §5;
observed for Doc Mitchell's front door]. So the XTEL positions of the doors whose
destination door is in a cell are the places the game itself puts the player in that
cell. GSGasStation has one: door 0x00109040 (outside, in WastelandNV; locked, level 255)
→ door 0x0010903F inside, arrival feet (511, −5951, 7554.2), heading 0° [observed]. Other
markers (XMRK map markers, a "COCMarkerHeading" base) are not used: their meaning is not
in these notes, and what the console's `coc` does in an interior is not documented here.

Rules (`nvf_play::player::safe`) [hypothesis unless tagged otherwise]:
- **Candidates**: the door arrivals into the cell (XTEL position and z rotation of every
  door whose destination door is in it, one-way doors included), nearest to the
  requested position first [engineering choice].
- **Standing test** [engineering choice]: the arrival rule's ray (half a capsule above to
  four capsules below, §6.2) hits a support whose normal is within `max_slope_deg` and
  that is not the reference the spot is for; the capsule (lifted by two skins) overlaps
  nothing there. The first candidate that passes is used and the arrival rule settles
  the feet; the player faces the XTEL heading.
- **Start** (`place_initial`): indoors, when the downward ray from the start eye finds
  nothing, the start moves to that spot, with a warning naming both positions (the far
  above ray stays for exterior starts under the terrain; indoors it would land on a roof).
- **Door destination** with nothing under it (checked once after each `Travel` into an
  interior): moved the same way.
- **Fall** (`interior_net`): feet more than **800 units** below the lowest bound of the
  cell's static collision (`PhysWorld::fixed_bounds`) [engineering choice, like the
  exterior's 1,000] → back to where the character last stood (if it can still stand
  there), else to a door arrival; with neither it is held at that depth (warned once).
  "Last stood" is cleared by `Travel`.

Results [observed 2026-10-08]: the start beside the box lands on the floor at the door
arrival; walking off the box is caught 800 units under the cell's lowest collision
(7532) and put at the door arrival (its last footing, the box's edge, no longer passes the
standing test), from where it walks into the room.

**Capture proposed for the owner** (not run; the game is in use by other sessions):
`coc GSGasStation`, then read `player.GetPos x|y|z` and `player.GetAngle z` (does `coc`
put the player at the door arrival (511, −5951, ~7554), at a marker, or elsewhere?);
then `player.SetPos` to x 682, y −4755, z 7552 (over nothing) and read z every 0.5 s for
10 s (does the game let the player fall, stop them, or move them?). Either result would
replace a [hypothesis] above.

## 7. CLI contract

Both commands take the load order like `fnvtool world` (`<data_dir> <plugins...>
--schema <dir>`), print one JSON document and add `"load_order"` (plugin names).

### `fnvtool phys cell ... (--cell <edid|formid> | --world <edid|formid> --x X --y Y) [--radius N] [--drop x,y[,z]]... [--drops-file F] [--seconds S] [--list-refs] [--ray x,y,z,dx,dy,dz[,max]]...` → `fnv.phys.cell/1`

Builds the world around a cell (for an exterior cell, the exterior cells within `N`
grid squares, default 1; the worldspace's persistent references standing in a loaded
square are included) and drops one probe character per `--drop` point (default: the
centre of the cell), each simulated alone for `S` seconds (default 5) with no input.
Without `z` the probe starts 100 units above what a downward ray finds. Negative
coordinates need `--drop=-1,2` or `--x=-18`.

(The example above predates mesh collision; with it, Goodsprings counts
`"with_collision": 839, "colliders": 1369`, `"disabled_by_parent": 10` and no `awaiting_collision`, §4.) Without
`--drop`, an exterior probe falls at the cell's centre and an interior one at the middle of
the placements that have collision; ground rays span the loaded terrain and placements
with 1,000 units to spare.

Both documents list `water`: `[{"grid": [x, y] | null (the interior), "surface": z}]`, the
water areas of the loaded cells (`Cell::water_surface`, §6.6), then one entry per placed
water volume `{"grid": null, "ref", "surface", "centre", "half_extents"}` (§6.6; `refs.counts`
gains `water_volume` for references whose model holds one); probes report `swimming` and
`water_surface` (the surface above the final feet, or null).

`refs.counts` keys appear only when non-zero: `placed`, `unreadable`, `deleted`,
`initially_disabled`, `disabled_by_parent` (enabled itself but disabled at the start by
its enable-parent chain, §4), `no_base`, `no_model`, `collision_primitive` (CollisionMarker
primitives added), `bad_primitive`, `speedtree`, `model_without_collision`,
`model_unreadable`, `awaiting_collision` (meshes not loaded), `with_collision`
(references added to the world), `colliders` (their collider count) and `object_errors`.
`by_base_type` counts references with a readable base by its record type.
`collision_source` is null without mesh collision, else `{"kind": "fnv_collide::nif",
"models", "models_with_collision", "models_unreadable", "unreadable_examples"}`. Mesh
collision needs the NIF schema: `--nif-schema <dir>`, by default `nif` next to the
`--schema` directory (skipped when absent); `--no-meshes` leaves it out. `--list-refs` adds `ref_list`: every reference in the world with `formid`, `base`
(`formid`, `type`, `edid`), `position`, `scale`, `objects` (`layer`, `layer_name`, `motion`,
`shell` × scale) and `top_hit` (the first hit, any layer, of a vertical ray at its position
from above the loaded content: `owner`, `z`, `normal`, `shell`). `--ray x,y,z,dx,dy,dz[,max]`
(repeatable) adds `rays`: `origin`, `dir` and the first `hit` (`owner`, `point`, `normal`,
`distance`, `shell`) or null. `--drops-file <file>` (`fnv.phys.drops/1`: `{"seconds"?,
"drops": [{"label", "at": [x, y] | [x, y, z], ...}]}`, other fields ignored) drops one probe
per entry, `seconds` replacing `--seconds`, and adds `observations`: `[{"label", "feet",
"support"}]` in file order (the lab compares `feet`, keyed on `label`). Owners are
`{"kind": "terrain", "grid": [x, y]}`, `{"kind": "ref", "formid", "object", "layer",
"layer_name"}` or `{"kind": "character", "id"}`.
`terrain_z` is `height_at` at the drop point (null outside loaded land);
`rest_above_terrain` = final feet z − `terrain_z` (the capsule rests its support's gap
above the surface along the contact normal, §6.2, so slightly more than the gap on
slopes). `gap` is the gap kept in the last step (`CharacterParams::rest_gap` of the
support: 3.5 on terrain, a model's shell, at least `skin`); `support` (`owner`, bare
surface `z`, `shell`) is what the arrival rule's ray finds under the final feet (from
half a capsule above to four below, ignoring the layers the character passes through,
the probe itself excluded; null if nothing) and `rest_above_support` = final feet z −
`support.z`, which on level ground equals the support's shell when the controller and
the arrival rule agree.
Output is deterministic (no timings).

### `fnvtool phys walk ... --script <file> (--world <edid|formid> | --cell <edid|formid>) [--radius N] [--every N] [--nif-schema <dir>] [--no-meshes]` → `fnv.phys.walk/1`

Builds the world as `phys cell` does around the cell holding the script's start (for
`--world`) or the given interior cell, adds one character and runs the script, stepping
the world once per script step. The script (`fnv.phys.walk-script/1`):

```json
{"schema": "fnv.phys.walk-script/1",
 "start": [-71680.0, 2048.0],
 "hz": 60,
 "params": {"step_height": 24.0},
 "segments": [{"steps": 30},
              {"steps": 300, "velocity": [250.0, 0.0]},
              {"steps": 1, "velocity": [250.0, 0.0], "jump": true}]}
```

`start` is the feet `[x, y]` (then on the contact shell of what a downward ray finds,
ignoring the layers the character passes through: `z + rest_gap(shell)`, §6.2) or
`[x, y, z]`;
`hz` the step rate (default 60, sets `dt`); `params` overrides `gravity` or any character
parameter (`radius`, `height`, `step_height`, `max_slope_deg`, `jump_height`, `skin`,
`max_fall_speed`, `push_mass`, `bottom_slope`, `bottom_flat`, and the swim parameters `swim_depth`, `float_depth`,
`swim_sink_speed`, `swim_jump_mult`, §6.6); each segment holds a horizontal velocity (units/s, world
axes, default 0) for `steps` steps, and `jump` presses jump on its first step; the
optional `view` ([x, y], the horizontal view direction) picks the backward landing profile
for a velocity pointing behind it (§6.4.1; without it the forward profile applies). The
velocity is the keys' velocity: the controller applies the air and landing rules. While the
character swims, a segment's optional `swim_velocity` ([x, y, z], units/s) is used
instead, scaled by the stroke cycle of its optional `stroke` (`"forward"`, `"back"` or
`"side"`; `fnv_phys::swim`, §6.6) counted from the first swimming step with a non-zero
`swim_velocity`; without `stroke` the speed is constant (§6.6 says why that stays the
default). A segment's optional `place` ([x, y, z]) puts the feet there before its first
step, keeping the swimming state, as the game's `SetPos` does. Output:
the `phys cell` document's world fields (`cell` ... `refs`, with `params` and `character`
as used), then

```json
{"start": [-71680.0, 2048.0, 8369.0],
 "summary": {"steps": 781, "seconds": 13.017, "end": [-70061.3, 3268.3, 8352.5],
             "horizontal_path": 2850.5, "min_z": 8344.5, "max_z": 8423.6, "jumps": 1,
             "landings": 2, "airborne_steps": 52, "swimming_steps": 0,
             "touched": [{"owner": {"kind": "terrain", "grid": [-18, 0]}, "steps": 359}]},
 "trace": [{"step": 1, "feet": [-71680.0, 2048.0, 8368.5], "vertical_speed": 0.0,
            "grounded": true, "sliding": false, "landed_speed": null, "gap": 3.5,
            "swimming": false, "touched": []}]}
```

`trace` holds every `--every`th step and the last. A script may add `"observe": {"from_step":
s, "every": n, "count": k}`: the output then holds `observations`, the feet (and `grounded`, `swimming`)
after steps s + n, s + 2n, … s + kn, labelled `"t<seconds after step s, two decimals>"`
(`t0.25` …); it must end within the script. Other top-level fields (e.g. the `capture`
block that `tools/capture/capture_moves.py` reads) are ignored. Runs are deterministic: the same
inputs give byte-identical output [observed: the Goodsprings script below, run twice].
`crates/fnv-phys/scripts/goodsprings_walk.json` is such a script (synthetic input, not a
capture); once the owner records a real walk (§6), a script with the same inputs and the
recorded positions become a parity scenario.

### `fnvtool phys heights ... --world <edid|formid>` → `fnv.phys.heights/1`

The physics terrain's height under eight fixed points of every landscape cell of a
worldspace, for comparison with an independent reader of the LAND data (parity lab
`L4.phys.heights.*`, oracle `tools/capture/oracle_phys.py`).

```json
{"schema": "fnv.phys.heights/1", "world": "0x000DA726", "edid": "WastelandNV",
 "points": [[5.0, 9.0], [27.0, 3.0], [13.0, 30.0], [30.0, 22.0],
            [8.2, 8.6], [24.6, 7.3], [7.7, 23.2], [23.9, 24.4]],
 "cells": [{"grid": [-64, -64], "heights": [1920.0004, 1951.9989, 1848.0, 1904.0009,
                                             1881.6007, 1924.8005, 1848.0, 1883.9999]}],
 "load_order": ["FalloutNV.esm", "..."]}
```

- **Cells**: every exterior cell of the worldspace's grid (one cell per grid square, the
  same selection as `fnvtool world heights`, world.md) whose CELL has a LAND record. A
  LAND without height data (no VHGT) gives `"heights": null`.
- **Points**: `points[i] = [u, v]` in grid steps (128 units) east and north of the cell's
  south-west corner `(gx · 4096, gy · 4096)`; the first four are vertices of the 33 × 33
  grid, the last four lie inside grid squares, away from both diagonals.
- **Heights**: `heights[i]` is the z where a vertical ray at
  `x = gx · 4096 + u · 128, y = gy · 4096 + v · 128` hits that cell's terrain collider
  (each cell alone in a world; `null` on a miss). The surface is the one §3 describes: at a
  vertex, the vertex height (world.md §3: VHGT integrated, × 8); inside the square with
  south-west vertex `(c, r)`, with `fu = u − c`, `fv = v − r` and `h00`, `h10` (east),
  `h01` (north), `h11` (north-east) its corner heights, the square is split along its
  south-west → north-east diagonal: if `fu ≥ fv`, `h = h00 + fu·(h10 − h00) + fv·(h11 − h10)`;
  otherwise `h = h00 + fv·(h01 − h00) + fu·(h11 − h01)`.
- **Precision**: the physics works in f32 at world coordinates up to about 2.6 × 10⁵ units
  and in metres internally; against the exact surface the rays are off by up to 0.19 units
  (`phys terrain`, §3). The lab compares with an absolute tolerance of 0.5 units, keyed on
  `grid`. On the owner's install all 30 `L4.phys.heights.*` scenarios pass; on WastelandNV
  the largest difference from the oracle is 0.154 units [observed]. Three of the four
  interior points fall in the south-east triangle of their square and one ([8.2, 8.6]) in
  the north-west one.

### `fnvtool phys terrain ... --world <edid|formid> [--samples N]` → `fnv.phys.terrain/1`

```json
{"schema": "fnv.phys.terrain/1", "world": "0x000DA726", "edid": "WastelandNV",
 "cells": 16386, "land_without_heights": [[23, -65], [24, -65]], "samples_per_cell": 126,
 "rays": 2064636, "misses": 0, "wrong_owner": 0, "mean_abs_error": 0.0018,
 "max_abs_error": 0.187,
 "worst": {"grid": [25, -59], "point": [105327.08, -239317.11], "physics_z": 441.36,
           "analytic_z": 441.18}}
```

Each landscape cell is built alone and probed with `N` scattered points (default 64) plus
62 points on its diagonal vertices and grid lines; errors are |ray hit z − `height_at`|.
A self-consistency check of the terrain colliders against the LAND data (no oracle).

## 8. Notes for workstream 1 (shape API)

- `fnv-phys` consumes `fnv_collide::{Shape, Iso, CollisionObject, Motion}` unchanged.
  It keeps its own uniform-scale helper (`convert::leaves` with a scale) rather than
  depending on `Shape::scaled`.
- Resolved: `fnv_collide::nif::collision_objects` gives node transforms in the mesh root's
  frame with the root's own transform excluded (collision.md), which is what §2 assumes;
  `fnvtool phys cell` calls it per model (fnv-phys itself reads no NIF blocks).
- Open: whether mesh collision objects use the XTRI layer numbering (§4), and which
  layers the original lets the player pass.
