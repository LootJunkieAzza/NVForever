# Pickpocketing (ESM full audit gap 6, 2026-10-24)

Sources: the GECK wiki export (owner's, `C:\fnv-private\geckwiki`): pages Pickpocket
(GameMechanics.xml), SetGhost, Category:NPC, Combat Tab (Pickpocket topics), Projectile
(notes on planted explosives), GetPlantedExplosive, ActorHasBaseFlag,
SetPlayerCanPickpocketEquippedItems and SetCaughtPCPickpocketting (functions.xml).
FalloutNV.esm's settings [observed: raw read, 2026-10-24]. Code: `fnv_game::pickpocket`
(rules), `nvf_play::pickpocket` (play), the container menu's steal mode
(`nvf_play::menu::model::Steal`).

## 1. Who can be pickpocketed

- Every NPC: NPCs "can all be pickpocketed" [documented: Category:NPC].
- A creature only with ACBS bit 28 Allow Pickpocket [documented: ActorHasBaseFlag]; 124
  in FalloutNV.esm (wild dogs, giant rats, big horners, ED-E's upgrade forms), 2 in Dead
  Money, 5 in Old World Blues, 4 in Honest Hearts, 1 in Lonesome Road [observed]. Read from
  the definition supplying the base data (template flag Base Data) [hypothesis].
- Not a ghost: "Cannot be pickpocketed, despite the prompt still showing up. Instead,
  regular activation (dialog) occurs" [documented: SetGhost notes]. NVForever shows
  Talk on a ghost instead of Steal [design: the original's prompt is a known quirk].
- Not dead (searched instead), not hostile to the player or fighting it (only its name
  shows, as for talking), not unconscious, not a teammate [hypothesis for the last two:
  a companion's inventory is open to the player through the wheel].
- Not one that caught the player before: it "has already caught you." (GMST
  `sNoPickPocketAgain` [observed]; SetCaughtPCPickpocketting "originally is set when
  player fails a pickpocket attempt … player can't pickpocket NPC anymore" [documented]).
  E on it shows that line after its name and opens nothing.
- The player must be sneaking (IsSneaking) [hypothesis: the Combat Tab's
  PLAYERPICKPOCKET topic is "used when the player is sneaking near an actor"; the
  original's E while sneaking opens the pocket].

The prompt reads **Steal** [hypothesis: the original's word is not in the masters' GMSTs].

## 2. The chance

```
chance = (thief Sneak × fPickPocketActorSkillMult + fPickPocketActorSkillBase)
       + (target Sneak × fPickPocketTargetSkillMult + fPickPocketTargetSkillBase)
       + (item value × fPickPocketAmountMult + fPickPocketAmountBase)
```

rounded down, kept within `fPickPocketMinChance` and `fPickPocketMaxChance` [documented:
Pickpocket]. Thief Skill is the player's Sneak, Target Skill the target's Sneak
[documented]. A creature's Sneak is its CREA Stealth skill (as GetActorValue Sneak reads
it, `actor_values`) [hypothesis].

| Setting | Wiki default | FalloutNV.esm |
|---|---|---|
| fPickPocketActorSkillMult | 0.6 | 0.6 |
| fPickPocketActorSkillBase | 40 | 40 |
| fPickPocketTargetSkillMult | −0.6 | −0.6 |
| fPickPocketTargetSkillBase | 0 | not set |
| fPickPocketAmountMult | −0.5 | −0.5 |
| fPickPocketAmountBase | 0 | not set |
| fPickPocketMinChance | 5 | not set |
| fPickPocketMaxChance | 85 | 85 |

- **Item value** is the moved units' value: one unit's value × the count moved
  [hypothesis: the wiki says "Item Value"; taking a stack of 50 caps at once is then much
  harder than taking one]. A key's value "is used to weight the chance of getting caught
  when pickpocketing the key" [documented: Key], which agrees.
- **Each take and each placement** rolls once against its chance [hypothesis: placing is
  judged as taking is]. The menu's line shows the chance of the selected row for one
  unit [design: the original's display is not captured].

## 3. The menu

The container menu on the victim's inventory, its title the victim's name. Equipped items
are not listed ("By default, the player cannot pickpocket equipped items" [documented:
SetPlayerCanPickpocketEquippedItems]; hypothesis: a stack with one unit equipped is hidden
whole). Take All is refused [design: each take is its own roll]. The game clock stops as
in any container menu.

## 4. Success and failure

- **Unseen take**: theft from the victim (its base is the owner): karma
  `fKarmaModStealing` (−5) unless the victim is Evil, as for any theft (crime-karma.md
  §3.1, an unseen theft costs karma too); Pockets Picked +1 per take [hypothesis: per take].
  No witness turns [hypothesis: others watching are not judged].
- **Caught** (the roll fails): nothing moves and the menu closes. The victim says
  **Pickpocket** ("Said by an actor if they notice you picking their pocket" [documented:
  Combat Tab]) and turns on the player as a seen thief does (a crime enemy; the crime
  counts against it as `Kind::Pickpocket`, a minor crime) [hypothesis: as Steal]. One that
  ignores crime says **PickpocketNoCrime** ("doesn't regard it as a crime" [documented])
  and does not turn. It will not be pickpocketed again (§1). No karma for a failed try
  [hypothesis].

## 5. Planted explosives ("exploding pants")

"Grenade and mine-type weapons that use an exploding projectile with the Alt. Trigger flag
can be reverse-pickpocketed onto NPCs. If successful the weapon goes live and explodes in
the NPC's inventory after fProjectileInventoryGrenadeTimer has elapsed, always killing it
regardless of its HP … GetPlantedExplosive will return true on the NPC after
fProjectileInventoryGrenadeFreakoutTime has elapsed" [documented: Projectile notes].
FalloutNV.esm: timer 2.0 s, freak-out 0.1 s [observed].

- A placed weapon whose projectile has Explosion and Alt. Trigger goes live, one per unit.
  The timers run on the game clock [hypothesis], so they stand still while the menu is
  open and start when it closes.
- **Not on a child or an essential actor.** Fallout 3 "just puts the explosive in a
  child's inventory", with no explosion [documented: Fallout Wiki, Fallout 3 Pickpocket
  page, owner's paste of 2026-11-05]. New Vegas is not described. NVForever does the same
  for a child (its race has the Child flag) and for an essential actor: the item stays an
  ordinary item and nothing goes off [hypothesis: observer check 98].
- **The panic.** From the freak-out time to the blast the victim panics. The masters'
  only GetPlantedExplosive condition is on the IDLE root `PanicExplosivePlanted`
  (0x00042F24, folder `Characters\_Male\IdleAnims`, GetPlantedExplosive == 1). Its two
  leaves are `PanicGrenadePlantPA` (0x00042F25, `PanicGrenadePlantPA.kf`, one condition:
  GetEquipped on form list 0x0008945E, the power armour) and `PanicGrenadePlant`
  (0x00040203, `PanicGrenadePlant.kf`, no conditions) [observed: FalloutNV.esm, raw read
  2026-11-06]. The add-on masters have none. The engine picks it the way the tree picks a
  fidget: the roots of the actor's own folder whose conditions name
  GetPlantedExplosive == 1, then the first leaf with a file whose conditions pass
  (`Game::panic_idle`). It plays once, as a special idle (GetAnimAction 13). No creature
  folder has such a root, so a creature plays nothing. People and creatures alike stand
  where they are until the blast; the issue says "slows or stops", and NVForever stops
  them [hypothesis]. The panic idle is not named in the code: a load order with another
  root naming GetPlantedExplosive gets its own.
- **When the timer is up**: the victim loses the explosive, Pants Exploded goes up by 1,
  and the projectile's explosion goes off where it stands. Its blast is the player's: it
  hurts others as a thrown grenade's does [hypothesis].
- **Only an explosion that hurts the victim's kind kills it** ("instantly killing them if
  it's a damaging type", owner 2026-11-05). The rule (`Game::explosive_harms`)
  [hypothesis: observer check 98]:
  - an actor that takes no damage (a child, an Invulnerable creature, a ghost) is not
    killed;
  - when the explosion's object effect (EXPL EITM) has effects that lower Health (base
    effect Hostile or Detrimental, Health as its actor value, magnitude above 0), they
    decide, by their conditions on the victim. The Pulse Grenade's `GrenadePulseExplosion`
    (0x000298A9, damage 10) carries ENCH `EMP` (0x0003A36B): Damage Health 200 when
    GetIsCreatureType 6 (robots), and 80 with a Pulse Disable effect when GetEquipped
    names one of six power armour lists [observed: FalloutNV.esm]. So a pulse grenade
    kills a robot or a power armour wearer and not an ordinary man, whose blast's 10
    points of EMP damage do not count;
  - otherwise the explosion's damage above 0, of a damage type (WEAP DNAM Resist) the
    victim does not wholly resist (its value of that resistance below 100). A frag grenade
    (`GrenadeFragExplosion`, 125, Resist None) and a plasma grenade (225, Energy
    Resistance) kill anyone [observed: `fnvtool combat weapon`].
  A victim that lives stays alive; its explosion goes off as for any other.
- **Crime and reputation.** "If the player stays hidden from the plant until the blast,
  nobody turns hostile and no infamy is gained" [documented: Fallout Wiki, New Vegas
  Pickpocket page, owner's paste of 2026-11-05]. The kill is the player's, judged as any
  kill (crime-karma.md: karma, murder, infamy, witnesses turning). Its witnesses are those
  who detect the player when it goes off, and also anyone who did while it was live: the
  witnesses are taken every frame from the plant to the blast
  (`Planted::seen_by`) [hypothesis: the sampling]. A player hidden all that time is seen
  by nobody, so the murder costs karma only.
- **Always murder.** Some important faction NPCs (Caesar, Lucius, Ambassador Crocker)
  always count as murder and give their faction infamy [documented: same page]. Nothing on
  the actors or factions marks them [observed: FalloutNV.esm: Caesar `FortCaesar`
  0x00121FEF has ACBS flags 0x04000010, Lucius `FortLucius` 0x0011FC9D 0x00000090,
  Crocker `VStreetDennisCrocker` 0x00112640 0x00000010; no shared flag, condition or
  faction]. Their own scripts do it, on death. Caesar's OnDeath (SCPT 0x00137622) sets
  stage 110 of quest 0x00129D14, Lucius's (0x001543B8) the same. That stage's result
  script calls `SetEnemy 0x000EE68A 0x0001B2A4`: the Legion and the player's faction
  become enemies. Crocker's OnDeath (0x001622CE) sets stage 200 of quest 0x0011F95B,
  whose result is `AddReputation 0x000F43DE 0 3`: NCR infamy [observed: `fnvtool script
  decompile`]. A planted kill is a kill (`Game::kill`), so these OnDeath blocks run
  whoever saw. NVForever has no rule or list of its own for them.
- **Kill credit.** "The kill counts as a kill with the weapon type the player has
  equipped, toward that weapon type's stats and challenges" [documented: same page]. The
  victim's last hit is set to the player with the weapon the player holds (fists when
  none) before it dies, so the challenges' weapon filters (challenges.md) count that
  weapon, not the grenade and not an earlier hit's weapon.
- GetPlantedExplosive is 1 from the freak-out time until it goes off.
- Not built: the "Detonates" variant (DetonatePlacedExplosives); the item shown as "Live"
  in the pocket; the victim not using or dropping it; the victim looking around during
  the panic and spotting a player nearby (#1640 item 5); keeping a fuse in a save
  (#1592 §3).

is logged as unseen or caught); `pickpocket-plant-dynamite` (Dynamite placed on Chet while sneaking goes live, he plays `PanicGrenadePlant`, it goes off and kills him, and no faction turns: a Frag Grenade is worth 150 caps, which leaves a 16% chance, so the seeded roll would catch it).
