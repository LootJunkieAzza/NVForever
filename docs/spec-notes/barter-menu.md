# Spec note: the barter and container menus

Tags as in `nif.md`: `[documented]` cites a page or file, `[observed]` says what was
looked at, `[hypothesis]` is a reading that nothing has confirmed yet. `[design]` marks
what is NVForever's own. Implementation: `engine/nvf-play/src/menu/look.rs` (the
drawing), `menu/model.rs` (lists, trade, commands), `menu/barter.rs` (prices),
`menu.rs` (opening, keys, pointer), `crates/fnv-game` `ShowBarterMenu`.

## 1. Sources

- **Four pictures from the owner**, 2026-10-11 (kept privately): two screenshots of the
  original's barter menu with the merchant Blake (1280 x 720 and 1600 x 1024, the second
  with a Gold Bar put up for sale), a small screenshot of the container menu on a
  refrigerator (384 x 216), and a cut from a web page showing a container menu with an
  item's figures (DPS, WG, VAL, STR, CND, ammunition, mods). The owner: the container
  menu looks "very similar" to the barter menu, without the caps.
- **The game's interface files** in `Fallout - Misc.bsa`: `menus\barter_menu.xml`,
  `menus\container_menu.xml` and the shared pieces they include
  (`menus\prefabs\list_box.xml`, `list_box_template.xml`, `scrollbar_vert.xml`,
  `item_stats_display.xml`, `card_info.xml`, `text_box.xml`, `bottom_bracket.xml`,
  `line.xml`, `vertical_fade_line.xml`, `box.xml`, `menus\globals.xml`). Described here
  in plain words; nothing of them is shipped.
- **The textures they name**, in `Fallout - Textures2.bsa`: the title arrows
  `textures\interface\main\main_arrow_left.dds` / `_right.dds`, the caps arrows
  `textures\interface\barter\barter_arrow_buy.dds` / `_sell.dds`, the item arrows
  `textures\interface\shared\arrow\left.dds` / `right.dds`, and from the shared atlas
  (`textures\interface\interfaceshared.tai`): `square.dds`, `square_filled.dds`,
  `arrow_up.dds`, `arrow_down.dds`, `vert_marker.dds`, `solid.dds`, `fade_to_top.dds`,
  `fade_to_bottom.dds`. Items' pictures are their ICON paths
  (`interface\icons\pipboyimages\items\...`).
- **The GECK wiki** (owner's export): "Barter System Formula", "Item Condition And
  Value", ShowBarterMenu, "Merchant Restocking", GetBarterGoldAlt, Service Tab.
- **FalloutNV.esm**: the barter settings, Chet's records.

## 2. What the files say

[documented: the two menu files and their pieces] In the interface's units (960 to the
screen's height):

- Both menus are a 1024 x 800 rectangle centred on the screen. Behind it a black
  picture (`interface\shared\background\solid_black.dds`) 40 left of it and 105 above,
  1144 x 970, with the shared background opacity (32 of 255).
- Two halves of 464 x 480: the player's 20 in and 20 down, the other 560 further right.
  Each has a heading: a short line fading downwards at each end, a line along the top,
  the title (font 6) 50 in with an arrow 17.5 x 35 before it at 30 and after it, the
  line resuming 20 after the right arrow, and a figure in font 2 right-aligned at 449,
  20 down. The barter menu's title stands 10 above the line, the container menu's 12.5.
  The player's title is the inventory's word for items; the other half's title is set
  by the code (the container's or merchant's name). The arrows are clickable and so are
  the titles (the mouse wheel on them).
- The barter menu has a figure on both halves (set by the code; the screenshots show
  the caps). The container menu has one on the player's half only (the screenshots show
  the weight carried and the most that can be).
- Each half's list is 15 left of the half and 60 down, 462 (player) or 464 wide and 365
  high, clipped. A scroll bar 32 wide sits at its left, with 16-high arrows at its ends
  and a marker 6 wide, 12 in, at least 32 high; it shows only when the list is longer
  than the window. The list scrolls by 26, half a row. Only one list is enabled at a
  time, the one with the focus; moving the pointer over a half gives it the focus.
- A row's height is its text's and 20. In a row, 32 right of the list's left (after the
  scroll bar's room): the name in font 2 at 40, 20 down, wrapped at 300 in the barter
  menu and 370 in the container menu; in the barter menu a value right-aligned at 403;
  at 15, 15 a 25 x 25 square, filled for an equipped item, open for an item chosen for
  the trade. The row under the pointer gets a box one unit shorter than the row, its
  lines at brightness 200 and its fill at 40 of 255 at half brightness. Rows play
  `UIMenuOK` when clicked and `UIMenuFocus` when the pointer comes on them.
- Each half's footer: lines fading upwards from 440 to 480 at its two ends and a line
  along 480.
- A bottom bracket under both halves 820 down the screen: a line with lines fading up
  40 at its ends.
- Barter only: between the halves, set visible by the code, the caps arrow: a picture
  120 x 360 (`barter_arrow_buy.dds` or `barter_arrow_sell.dds`, chosen by the code's
  direction) and the amount in font 6 centred over the word "Caps" in font 2. The
  arrow's rectangle is 449 right of the player's half and 260 down the screen; with
  the second direction everything moves 20 right, the picture 25 left within it, and
  the figure 7.5 right; a figure wider than 70 moves by its excess.
- Container only: between the halves, set visible by the code, an item arrow 64 x 128
  (`left.dds` or `right.dds`), 474 right of the player's half and 250 down the screen.
- Buttons at the bottom right (text boxes, right-aligned, the right end 10 left of the
  other half's right end, 670 down the screen, each its text and 15 high): Accept and
  Exit in the barter menu, Take All and Exit in the container menu, each followed by its
  PC key hint. Accept is drawn at 128 of 255 when it cannot be used.
- The item's picture (256 x 256) 22 right of the player's half and 472 down from it,
  and the item's figures 535 down from the halves: 287 into the menu (barter) or 307 into
  the player's half (container). The figures are tiles a third of 530 x 120 (176.7 x 40):
  damage, damage per second, resistance or threshold at the left; weight at the
  second third and 10; value at the third; strength needed above the value; condition
  as a bar (62 in, 15 down, 20 high, 72 short of the tile) and the ammunition at the
  second row; effects and mods across. A tile has a line along its top, a line fading
  down its right side, its title at 5 and its value right-aligned 10 before its end,
  both 20 down.
- Container only: a text centred under the menu, 800 down the screen.
- Fonts by number: font 2 is `Monofonto_Large`, font 6 `Glow_Monofonto_VL_dialogs`
  (`fonts.md` §4). Lines are 2 thick on a PC.

## 3. What the screenshots add

[observed, the 1280 x 720 barter screenshot unless said otherwise]

- Positions agree with §2 to a pixel or two: the names start 57 right of the half, the
  values end 420 right of it, the weight and value tiles stand at the second and third
  thirds 555 down, the Accept text's right end at 1024 of the menu.
- Rows are 51 apart (39 pixels at 720 lines, 54 at 1024), seven to a list.
- A row reads "Name (count)" when there is more than one; caps are not listed in the
  barter menu but shown as "Caps  N" in each heading; the container's player heading
  reads "Wg  carried/most". The container lists "Bottle Cap (18)" as an item.
- Rows are sorted by name in byte order: "$5 NCR" and ".223 Round" before digits and
  letters, "LAER+" before "Lad's Life" (capitals before small letters).
- The values are prices, not the items' values: at Barter 100 the Gold Bar (value
  10547) shows 9492, Hydra (55) 50, Jet (20) 18, the .308 Armor Piercing round (9) 10,
  the .308 Round (4) 4, the $5 NCR (2) 2. Items worth nothing show "--"; Embalming Fluid
  shows "0.9". The VAL tile shows the item's own value (10547).
- An item chosen for sale leaves the player's list and stands first in the merchant's
  list with the open square (second screenshot: Gold Bar, value 9492); the arrow points
  at the player with "9492 Caps".
- The key hints read "Accept A)", "Exit X)" (barter) and "Take All R)", "Exit E)"
  (container; "Take All A)" on the 2026-11 launchtest shot, §8); the hint stands about 16 after its button's text. Accept is dim with
  nothing chosen and bright with a trade.
- The picture behind darkens the world by about a third at its left edge, with a soft
  edge about 25 wide; the world behind is blurred (second screenshot).
- The container screenshot's note reads "This container respawns and is unsafe to
  store your items."

## 4. Barter rules

- **Prices** [documented: GECK wiki "Barter System Formula"]: buying costs the value
  times `fBarterBuyBase + Barter × fBarterBuyMult / 100`, selling fetches the value times
  `fBarterSellBase + Barter × fBarterSellMult / 100`; a bought item never costs less
  than its value and a sold one never fetches more. FalloutNV.esm sets the four settings
  to the page's defaults: 1.55, -0.45, 0.45, 0.45 [observed: `fnvtool esm decode`].
  Barter is the player's skill; the merchant's does not count [documented].
- **Rounding** [observed: §3, all the screenshot's prices]: to the nearest cap, halves
  up; under one cap one decimal is kept [hypothesis: from the single "0.9" row].
- **Condition** [documented: "Item Condition And Value"]: an item's value is multiplied
  by `fItemConditionValueBase + (1 − base) × fItemConditionValueMult × (condition % /
  10) ^ fItemConditionValueExp`; FalloutNV.esm sets the base to 0 and the multiplier to
  0.0316 and has no exponent, so the page's default 1.5 is used [observed].
- **Discount** [documented: GECK wiki ShowBarterMenu]: `ShowBarterMenu 50` makes the
  merchant sell at half and buy at one and a half of the normal prices; the parameter is
  -100 to 100. It is applied after the limits [hypothesis].
- **The merchant's goods and caps** are its merchant container's (the XMRC of its
  reference) [observed: Chet's `VendorContainerChet` holds his stock and two vendor caps
  lists of 300; his own inventory holds a few items and pocket change]. The merchant's
  own inventory is not offered [hypothesis]. Without a merchant container, the actor's
  own inventory is used [design].
- **What the merchant sells** is limited to its service categories (AIDT "Buys/Sells",
  or its class's): the other items of its stock are held back; it buys anything
  [documented: GECK wiki Class; the categories: vendor-services.md §2].
- **The total** is the sum of each line's rounded price times its count [hypothesis].
  Accept is refused when the side that pays has too few caps [hypothesis; the wording is
  ours: "You don't have enough caps." / "<merchant> doesn't have enough caps."].
- **Quest items** cannot be sold [documented: GECK wiki Category:Items]; they are not
  listed [hypothesis].
- **Restocking** on two days of the week [documented: "Merchant Restocking"] is the
  simulation's (`fnv-sim` merchant restock days), not the menu's.
- **The menu's code** for `MenuMode` is 1053 [hypothesis: the GECK wiki's list as
  remembered; no shipped script tests it].

## 5. What NVForever does

- Draws both menus by §2 and §3 with the game's two fonts and pictures, read from the
  owner's archives at run time; without them the same layout with Bevy's font and plain
  lines.
- The player's half is at the left (as the files have it; the earlier plain container
  menu had it at the right).
- Category arrows switch each list between all items, weapons, apparel, aid, misc and
  ammunition [observed: titles "ITEMS" and "MISC"; the rest hypotheses]. The other
  half's title is its name for all items, else the category's name [hypothesis].
- Names wrap onto a second line as the files say; a two-line row is 35 taller.
- The pointer selects the row it moves onto and gives its half the focus, and never
  scrolls the list: a row half shown at the list's foot stays where it is when the pointer
  takes it; only the wheel and the keys scroll [design: the owner's rule, playtest list 7
  item 11; `MenuModel::pointer_pick`]. A click acts
  on the row (barter: chooses one unit for the trade, or takes it back; container: takes
  or stores one), Shift and a click the whole stack [design: the original asks how many
  with its quantity menu, not built]. The keys are listed in `menu.rs`'s notes: the
  hints' letters (A, X, R, E) as the screenshots show them, Esc and Tab to leave,
  `[` and `]` for the categories [design].
- The item's picture and its figures: the Pip-Boy ITEMS page's (pipboy.md §4–§5,
  `nvf_play::pipboy::items::info_of` and `tiles_in`, the same `item_stats_display.xml`)
  laid out in this menu's 530 × 120: DAM (weapons) or DT (armour), DPS over it, STR over
  the value, CND as a bar for weapons and armour, the ammunition or armour class beside
  it, the effects across [design: the owner's wish, playtest list 7 item 25]; WG and VAL
  stay one unit's, WG with two decimals [observed], VAL at the unit's condition before
  the trade's multiplier. Log `menu: figures of <item>: <tiles>`. The mods tile is not
  built.
- Currency (NCR notes, Legion coins) are the caravan money records (CMNY) that
  inventories hold; their worth is their DATA "Absolute Value" (`Item::money`), the Value
  of the MISC records of the same names [observed: FalloutNV.esm; playtest list 7 item
  7].
- The caps arrow and its figure are drawn at half brightness, as a disabled button is,
  while the side that pays holds fewer caps than the balance (Accept is then refused)
  [design: the owner's request].
- The container menu's note shows for a container whose record has the Respawns flag
  [hypothesis: every such container]; a refused trade's words show in the same place
  [design].
- The world behind is darkened by a third [observed] with the background picture's soft
  edges; its blur is not built (the message box note has the same gap).
- `ShowBarterMenu` (fnv-game) opens the menu for scripts (MenuMode 1053) and asks the
  engine to draw it. From a dialogue choice the menu opens over the conversation, which
  waits under it and goes on when it closes [hypothesis: the original returns to the
  conversation].

Not built: the BarterExit lines merchants say when the menu closes (GECK wiki Service Tab),
the blur, the mods tile, the "Calculate Buy Price" perk entry point, repair at merchants. The
menus from their files: §8.

## 6. Looking at one

- `NVF_PLAY_TEST_BARTER=<merchant reference>[:discount]` opens the barter menu with that
  merchant and makes one trade, logging the lists, prices and caps; with
  `NVF_PLAY_TEST_SHOT=<path.png>` it saves `<stem>-barter.png` and
  `<stem>-barter-trade.png`. With `*` it waits for a script to open one.
  `NVF_PLAY_TEST_BARTER_DELAY` gives it a delay of its own (else `NVF_PLAY_TEST_DELAY`),
  so that it can run beside the container check. Its sounds: audio.md §12.
- The dialogue path, Chet in the Goodsprings General Store:
  `NVF_PLAY_TEST_TALK="10:GSChetRef=for sale|leave" NVF_PLAY_TEST_BARTER="*"
  NVF_PLAY_TEST_SCRIPT_MENUS=0.3 nvforever --data <Data> --cell GSGeneralStore --play
  --no-voice --size 1280x720 --run-seconds 50` (expect "menu: a script opens the barter
  menu with 0x00104C79", "menu: barter with 0x00104C79: stock in 0x00104C7A", a trade,
  "menu: close", then the conversation's Goodbye).
- `NVF_PLAY_TEST_MENU=nearest` does the same for the container menu (menu.rs).

Checked this way on 2026-10-11 at 1280 x 720: Chet's menu matches the owner's barter
screenshot's layout (headings, lists, prices' column, tiles, icon, buttons, bracket)
within a few pixels; the refrigerator of GSHouseInterior03 matches the container
screenshot.

## 7. How many? (moving part of a stack)

Sources: `menus\quantity_menu.xml` and its prefabs `meter.xml`, `top_bracket.xml`,
`bottom_bracket.xml` [documented: the owner's extraction of the game's menu files, read in
plain language here]; three screenshots of the original over the Pip-Boy, a stack of six
Varmint Rifles being dropped, at 1920 × 1080 (C:\fnv-private\itemstacks) [observed].

- **When it asks** [owner, 2026-10-15]: moving a stack of more than 5 units (take, store,
  buy, sell, take back from the trade, drop from the inventory). The original's threshold
  is a game setting with no record in FalloutNV.esm; it was not read, so "more than 5"
  is the owner's word. Five or fewer move one unit per press, as before.
- **Layout** (interface units, 960 to the screen's height): a 740 × 370 box centred on the
  screen, on the shared black background picture at the menus' backing; inside it, 22 in
  and 42 down, a frame 690 wide: a top bracket and a bottom bracket 290 lower, each a line
  with 50-long ends fading towards the other. "How many?" (game string `sHowMany`, not in
  the masters; the screenshots spell it) in font 2, centred at 345, 50 down. The meter at
  149.5, 115, 391 × 24, with the left and right arrows (`main_arrow_left/right.dds`,
  17.5 × 35) at 130 and 549. The amount in font 6 centred at 345, 170 down. Ok and
  Cancel right-aligned at 665, 155 and 200 down, with their key hints "A)" and "E)".
- **The meter**: a ground of the interface colour at a quarter of its opacity, and over it
  `hud_tick_mark.dds` repeated as far as the value (0 to 1) reaches. The value shown is
  the amount over the stack; the amount is the value times the stack, rounded. A drag
  sets the value from the pointer; the arrows step it.
- **The screenshots agree** [observed]: the frame is 775 × 327 pixels (690 × 291 units at
  1080 lines), its ends fade over about 50 units, ticks are 9 pixels (8 units) apart,
  and the first screenshot shows the whole stack (6 of 6), the later ones 4 and 3.

What NVForever does (`engine/nvf-play/src/menu/model.rs` `Quantity`, `look.rs`
`spawn_quantity`): the prompt opens at the whole stack, goes from 1 to the stack, Ok does
what asked with that many, Cancel (or closing) does nothing and leaves the menu open. Keys:
Left/Right and the wheel ±1, Page Up/Down ±10, Home/End 1 and the stack, A/Enter/Space
Ok, E/Esc Cancel [documented: A) and E); the rest ours]. While it is open the menu and the
Pip-Boy take no other key. Shift (whole stack) and Shift + right click on the
Pip-Boy's ITEMS page (drop the stack) still move the
stack without asking [design]. Over the Pip-Boy the prompt is drawn centred on the window
[hypothesis: the original draws it on the Pip-Boy's screen; the screenshots show it
centred over it]. Smoke scenario `item-stacks`; `NVF_PLAY_TEST_DROP=<s>:<item>:ask`
leaves it open for a screenshot.

**Drawn from its file (T15a).** With `[UI] TileMenus=QuantityMenu` the prompt of the
container, barter and inventory menus is drawn from the game's `QuantityMenu` tiles
(`engine/nvf-play/src/tiles/menus.rs`), the code above not spawned once the tree has the
file (the frame the prompt opens draws it by hand once; a missing file keeps it hand-built);
the crafting menu's prompt stays drawn by it. With `[UI] TileMenus=ContainerMenu` alone only
the prompt over a container menu actually drawn from its tiles is (§8) [design]: a container
menu that fell back to its hand-built drawing, and the barter and inventory menus, keep the
hand-built prompt. The tree builds the file while the prompt
shows, whatever the switch (`Game::ui_prompt`, as the open menus build; MenuMode does not
report it): with neither switch on its tiles are readable by scripts but nothing writes or
draws them. The code writes the meter's `user0`
(the stack) and `user2` (the amount) and the step sizes `user3`/`user4` (1 and 10, ours)
[documented: the file's comments on them]; the file works out the meter's value, its
fill (the tick picture tiled over the value's part of the meter: one picture, no piece
per tick) and the amount's text. The words are the game strings `sHowMany`, `sOK`,
`sCancel` and the key hints `sPCMenuHintA`/`E` (menu-xml.md §2.4; NVForever's own labels
when the load order has none). A pointer click on OK, Cancel or an arrow does what the
keys do; a press on the meter, held as it drags, sets the amount under the pointer; the
keys stay the ones above (the file's bindings act for a script's MenuTapKey and for the
controller's buttons that stand in for no key). Smoke `tiles-quantity`,
`tiles-container-quantity-alone`; the drop aid's
`ask` now holds the prompt open until it is answered.

## 8. The container menu from its file (T15c)

Behind `[UI] TileMenus=ContainerMenu` (`engine/nvf-play/src/tiles/container_menu.rs`,
`tiles/list.rs`, `tiles/item_card.rs`, issue #1468) the open menu (1008) is drawn from
`menus\container_menu.xml` and the hand-built drawing gives way to a sheet taking the pointer
at its stacking level (100). The model, its keys and the wheel stay the hand-built menu's
(§5). The prompt draws over it from `QuantityMenu`'s file, with no switch of its own, or by
hand when that file is missing or short of a path (§7) [design], and takes the pointer alone
[documented: `&no_click_past;`]. Smoke: `tiles-container`, `tiles-container-quantity`,
`tiles-container-quantity-alone`, `container-default-drawing`. Not the default; what still differs from the original closes this
section.

The original's values [observed: the private `hud_container_*` capture at 1280 x 720, read
with JIP on a footlocker; interface units; parts a to g, with their shots in the latest run]:

- **The rows**: a row is `height` = its text's and 20: 32 and 52 for one line, 67 and 87 for
  two, 102 and 122 for three. `_y` the sum above it. `_selected` stays 0 on the selected row.
  `target` 1 on the rows of both lists. Text x 40, y 20, wrap 370, font 2. A row's tile has
  its item's name, without the count (`GetActiveUIComponentName`); the tree's order is not
  the list's, `listindex` is.
- **Both lists have `_enabled` 1** at every read, against the prefab's comment. The list
  without the selection reads `_highlight_y` -1 and `_selected_height` 0 and shows no
  highlight; so does a list when the pointer leaves all rows (no selection at the opening
  either: `sel none`). The highlight box is 1 less than the row high, at the row's `y` after
  the scroll (a row at `_y` 208 with value 4: -23.11), hudmain at brightness 128, alpha 40
  (message-menu.md).
- **The scrollbar**: `_number_of_visible_items` is always 1. A list that fits reads 1 item; a
  right list with nothing filtered read the file's `_scroll_delta` 26, one with 15 of 16 rows
  filtered 57.2 (below, "Heading, filter"). Longer ones:

  | rows | total height | list | `_number_of_items` | `_scroll_delta` | `_jump_size` | marker height, `_step_height` |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 15 | 885 | 365 | 10 | 57.78 | 6 | 33.30, 33.30 |
  | 16 | 937 | 365 | 11 | 57.20 | 6 | 32, 30.10 |

  [hypothesis] That is: the value's range is the rows less those that fit whole from the top
  (6 here), and `_scroll_delta` what is left over by that range, so a value's move is not a
  row's. A row's `y` is `_y` less value x `_scroll_delta` (-231.11 at value 4 of 57.78), by
  the file [documented].
- **What moves it**: `ClickMenuTile` on the down arrow: +1, kept every frame after; on a page
  area: 6 up to the end (4 to 9, 8 to 2). The rows move under a resting pointer, and the row
  now there takes the highlight in the original. `SetInCode` read 0 through those.
- **The clip**: at y 390 pixels the pointer is on a row, at 399 on nothing: the list's bottom
  is at 525 units (393.75 pixels). So `clipwindow` crops the pointer too, as the drawing's
  reading has it (menu-xml.md §3.1.1).
- **The alpha of containers**: the scrollbar image reads `alpha` 0, its marker 255, and the
  arrows show [observed: launchtest shot]. `CM_TakeAllButton` and `CM_ExitButton` are images
  and `CM_Subtitle` a rect with `alpha` 0 from `text_box.xml`, and the words show.
  `StrengthReqInfo` at the opening is shown at `alpha` 0: its words do not show, and its top
  line and fading side line do, at about (782, 447) to (912, 470) pixels [observed: launchtest
  shot]; its value text copies its `alpha`, its lines their own `_line_alpha`. So in this
  menu an `alpha` is not passed down to children [hypothesis: elsewhere].
- **The backing**: `CM_Background` `alpha` 193.8 (the file's global is 32), 1144 x 970,
  brightness 128.
- **The card** (`CM_ItemData`): `_Value` and `visible` per card; `--` for no weight; DAM's
  `alpha` reads 0, 8.25, 98, 121.5, 238.75 and 255 between reads of weapons, DPS's title 255,
  both at one place by the file, so it seems they fade into each other [hypothesis]. STR
  `alpha` 255 once anything was selected. `AmmoInfo`'s `_Title` the ammunition `name (n/m)` or
  armour's class, `_Value` empty. `ConditionInfo`'s `user5` the condition, `user6` 1 for
  weapons, 0 for armour; its `CNDArrows` x 140.5 (114.33 with `user6` 0), y 15, 16 x 20 once
  selected, y 17, 16 high before. After the pointer leaves all rows the card keeps its last
  item while the icon and arrow hide.
- **The picture and the arrow**: `CM_ItemIcon` `filename` the item's, a missing one
  `missing_image.dds`; `CM_ArrowIcon` `user0` 1 (the left list's row), 2 (the right's), hidden
  without a selection.
- **The buttons**: Take All 116 x 47 at -116, 0 of `CM_ButtonRect`, Exit 68 x 47 at -68, 45,
  hints "A)" and "E)" [observed: launchtest shot, which reads "Take All A)", unlike §3's
  earlier reading "R)"]. `ClickMenuTile` on Take All takes all and closes, no prompt, no
  message after. The weight label "Wg   52/200", three spaces.

What the tile path does with these, and where it differs:

- **Follows the file and the capture**: places, rows, counts, scroll, highlight and its fill,
  bar pieces, backing alpha 193.8, every tile's own alpha, card fields, arrow, icon.
- **Stays the hand-built menu's on purpose**: a row always selected in a list that has rows
  (no "no selection" state); the pointer leaving keeps the selection; the wheel moves the
  selection [owner 2026-10-22, #1192], a list moved under a resting pointer does not take the
  highlight, hover does not scroll [owner's playtest list 7, item 11]; more than five asks
  how many [owner 2026-10-15]; Take All closes [owner, list 5 item 60]; DPS a card above DAM,
  no fade [owner's playtest list 7, item 25]. The keys: physical A focuses the player's list
  and R takes all, [design: `crate::menu`, tagged there as the owner's screenshot's "R)" and
  our own keys, no owner decision]; the file's A acts only for a script's MenuTapKey.
- **The words on the tiles**: the hints come from the strings table, as every key hint of the
  files does: Exit's `sPCMenuHintE` from the file, Take All's `sPCMenuHintR` written in code for
  the key that works; a GMST wins, else `fnv_ui::strings::BUILT_IN`'s label in its bracket form
  (so not the original's or the hand-built menu's letter and bracket). The prompt over the menu
  reads the same way, from `QuantityMenu`'s file: `sPCMenuHintA` and `sPCMenuHintE` after `sOK`
  and `sCancel` [design] (the hand-built prompt, kept for the frame it opens and for a fallback,
  keeps its own letters). The cards' titles read
  settings no plugin defines [observed: menu-xml.md §2.4], so the file shows `BUILT_IN`'s
  labels, and the tile menu leaves them as they are [design: the string rule, LEGAL.md; the
  short words the original shows on its cards are not in the data files and are not
  transcribed]. A plugin's setting, a mod's file or a script sets its own title. Those labels
  do not fit a card (`ConditionMeter` stands 62 in and a title 5 in [documented]; the label of
  the weight measures 72 units [observed: our shot]); how the card makes room for them, or
  what shorter words NVForever writes of its own, is open. The hand-built figures
  (`pipboy/items.rs`) keep their words, which this menu does not change.
- **Heading, filter**: a click on a heading steps its category on, as its right arrow
  [observed: `container__category_heading_click`, 2 to 3]. `_num_filtered` is written, the rows
  the category leaves out [observed: 10 of 15, 12 of 15, 15 of 16]; the original keeps those
  rows' tiles at `listindex` -1 with stale `y`s and this menu unloads them [design], so a mod
  looking for a filtered row's tile finds none. A list that comes to fit keeps its last
  `_scroll_delta`, and has 26 only before it ever overflowed: [observed] once, 57.2 with 15 of 16
  filtered; [hypothesis] for every list, from that one case.
- **The scroll follows** the selected row on a key's or the wheel's move (also one ending on the
  same row) and when the row's place, the list's height or the scroll's scale (a wrap below the
  row) changes under a key's pick; never on a
  pointer's pick [owner's playtest list 7, item 11], and the bar and marker stay free otherwise.
- **The weight** cuts off to whole units [observed: 289.50 reads "Wg   289/200", 49.50 "Wg
  49/200"]; the hand-built label rounds (`look::half_figure`), left as it is.
- **Against the original's shots** [observed: pixels at 1280 x 720, the file's numbers drawn;
  bounding boxes of the amber above a threshold, the same item's card on both sides]: the card's
  lines 641-774 and 781-914 at y 476 against 642-774 and 782-914 at y 477; the picture
  307-426 x 482-571 against 309-426 x 483-571 (`CM_ItemIcon`, 256 square at &scale;, 22 and 472
  from the half: places and size agree); the arrow 626-669 x 192-287 pointing left, 632-674 x
  191-284 right; Take All's words 953-1052 x 512-532 in both; the headings and the weight within
  1 pixel; text colour (198, 141, 49) against (198, 142, 51); list rows, the wrapped row's 66
  pixels, the clip at the list's foot and the highlight box 704-1024 agree. The empty container's
  STR lines 781-913 x 447-470 agree. A bar shows only on a list that overflows, on either side, in
  both.
- **Still different, and why**:
  - The backing reads darker here against the world; the world differs between the shots too,
    so 193.8 stands unchecked. The world now blurs behind the menu (image-modifiers.md, issue
    #1484); these shots were taken before it did.
  - The picture and the fading side lines are brighter here, in both our drawings, one
    picture peaking at red 227 against 197 [observed]. 197 / 254 through the
    sRGB curve is 227 / 254, so the picture's mid-tones may be read as linear [hypothesis]; a
    matter of the shared texture path, for every interface picture, not of this menu.
  - The opening shows a selected row, its highlight, arrow, picture and card; the original shows
    none until the pointer is on a row (`sel none`, `_highlight_y` -1), and hides them again when
    it leaves. This menu keeps a row selected (above); the keys act on it. A question for the
    owner, not changed here.
  - Take All on an empty list is dimmed, its `target` 0; the original's words stay at full
    brightness and the click closes the menu (`container__empty_takeall`). Empty Take All not
    closing is the hand-built menu's rule (§5), and the dim says so.
  - DPS a card above DAM, no fade [owner]; the original's DPS stands in DAM's place, as the shots
    show.
  - Words: the hints, as above.
  - DAM/DPS's fade, `_wheelmoved` and the marker's own drag traits are not built. The tile path's
    `ConditionMeter` and `CNDArrows` follow the numbers read (meter 104.67 wide, image the
    condition's part, arrows x 140.5 or 114.33, y 15, 16 x 20) and are not yet compared by eye:
    `tiles-container`'s `card_*` shots hold them (a weapon, armour, an aid item).
