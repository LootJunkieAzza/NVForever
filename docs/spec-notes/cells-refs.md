# Cells and references from the ESM (ESM gap audit, 2026-10-22)

The ESM gap audit's medium group "Cells and references"
([esm-gap-audit-2026-10-21](../handoff/esm-gap-audit-2026-10-21.md)) lists CELL, REFR,
ACTI and TERM fields that were decoded but not acted on. Activate parents (XAPD/XAPR)
were built before (#547, traps.md). Bit meanings: GECK wiki GetFormFlag (record header
flags, adapted from FNVEdit) and GetCellFlag [documented]; layouts from xEdit (schemas
`world.json`, `common.json`, `objects.json`). Counts are from FalloutNV.esm [observed: a
raw read of the master, 2026-10-22]: 30,497 cells and 307,710 placed references.

## 1. Can't Wait (CELL record header bit 19)

Nine interior cells: `Gomorrah00`, `Gomorrah01`, `HooverDamExt`, `HiddenValleyBunker1`,
`ULMembersOnly`, `OVWestSewers03`, `LegateCampTent`, `FreesideAtomicWrangler2`,
`FollowersOutpostInterior`. The Wait menu (and sleeping) refuses in such a cell with the
line a script's ban gives, "You cannot wait here" (`Refusal::Forbidden`, wait-menu.md)
[hypothesis: which line]. It is checked after the script's ban, swimming, falling and
radiation, and before trespass (wait-menu.md §9 order). Logged: `wait menu: refused: …
is flagged Can't Wait`.

## 2. Inaccessible doors (REFR record header bit 8)

85 door references (and 47 others, where bit 8 has other meanings for other record
types) carry it; many have an Activation Prompt such as "Inaccessible Tunnel". Such a
door is shown with its name and the action "Inaccessible", and E does nothing: no
teleport, no opening, no script [hypothesis: the flag's name; GetLockedOut's value 3
"Inaccessible" (JIP) [documented] says such a door is locked out]. Scripts may still
activate it.

## 3. Activation prompts (XATO)

156 references (doors mostly: "Exit to Mojave Wasteland" 24, "Climb Ladder to Mojave
Wasteland" 11, "Call Elevator" 10 …) and 59 activators ("Play Roulette", "Play Slots",
"Read Note", "Pick Banana Yucca" …) carry one. The JohnnyGuitar function
GetRefActivationPromptOverride names it the reference's "Activation Prompt Override"
[documented]. Under the crosshair the prompt's action line shows the reference's XATO,
else its ACTI base's, in place of the action word ("Open", "Activate"); the second line
(the name, or a door's destination) stays [hypothesis: the override replaces the verb].
It does not replace a lock's or key's line, nor an inaccessible door's.

## 4. Nothing to build

- **Off Limits** (CELL header bit 17, "Dangerous / Off limits (Interior cell)"
  [documented: GetFormFlag]): one cell, `ULPenthouse`. The wiki does not say what the
  flag does; ownership and trespass already decide the penthouse. Stored as before.
- **Behave Like Exterior** (CELL DATA bit 7) and **XCCM** (an interior's climate): no
  cell in FalloutNV.esm uses either; the add-ons have one cell each [observed: `fnvtool
  esm fields` over the ten masters, esm-audit-2026-10-25 §4]. Neither is read.
- **Leveled Lock** (XLOC flag bit 2): none of FalloutNV.esm's 426 locked references has
  it, but the add-ons do: Dead Money 22, Old World Blues 3, Honest Hearts 1 [observed:
  docs/handoff/esm-full-audit-2026-10-24.md gap 24]. No source gives the rule; since
  2026-10-24 a leveled lock hardens with the level (simulation.md, leveled locks;
  encounter-zones.md) [hypothesis].
- **TERM Leveled** (DNAM flags bit 0): eleven terminals. "If the terminal is leveled, the
  actual lock level may be adjusted" [documented: GECK wiki Lock] gives no rule, and no
  game setting does either; hacking.md §6 keeps the stored difficulty.

## 5. Checks

Unit tests: `crime::tests::cell_flags_from_raw` (Can't Wait), nvf-play `activate::tests`
(an inaccessible door, a reference's and an activator's prompt). Smoke: `wait-cant-wait`
(the Wait menu refused in Gomorrah), `activation-prompt-door` (the prompt of a Goodsprings
door with XATO). No smoke for §2: the two flagged doors tried (the Prospector Saloon's
0x00108BC8, the Nipton town hall's 0x00131E6B) were never under the crosshair in ours,
likely decorative models without collision for the picker [observed, 2026-10-22]; whether
the original lets the player target them is a capture question.
