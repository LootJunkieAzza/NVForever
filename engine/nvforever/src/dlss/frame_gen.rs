//! DLSS Frame Generation (DLSS-G) through Streamline, the spike's stages 1b and 2 (#2317;
//! fork-notes `fg-spike-design.md`). Not FSR's frame generation (`crate::frame_gen`), which never
//! starts while DLSS-G is loaded.
//!
//! - **`NVF_DLSSG_SPIKE=loaded`** (stage 1b): DLSS-G stays loaded with its mode off, so the
//!   window presents through Streamline's proxy swapchain while no frame is generated: the
//!   options are set once (mode `eOff`, `eRetainResourcesWhenOff`, the error callback) and the
//!   state is read after every present.
//! - **`NVF_DLSSG_SPIKE=on`** (stage 2): one frame generated per real frame (or
//!   `NVF_DLSSG_FRAMES`, 1 to 3, at most what the state allows), in play:
//!   - [`set_constants`] (before the frame is recorded): the common constants once a frame for
//!     whichever upscaler draws (FSR or DLSS; `evaluate.rs` `constants_for`), with our frame
//!     number's token (`frame_token.rs`); DLSS's evaluate then sets none of its own.
//!   - [`tag`] (after the post passes, before the UI, where FSR's frame generation copies its
//!     frame without the HUD, `crate::frame_gen` `capture_hudless`): on a frame that may be
//!     generated ([`may_generate`]) the frame without the HUD is copied into a display-sized
//!     texture of its own (two used in turn), the upscaler's depth (`PreparedUpscale::depth`,
//!     render size), the prepass motion (its render rectangle) and that copy are moved to
//!     `RESOURCE` on Bevy's encoder and tagged `eValidUntilPresent` with `slSetTagForFrame`,
//!     each `Resource` reporting the layout wgpu-hal puts `RESOURCE` in, as the SR evaluate does
//!     (`DEPTH_STENCIL_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` for the depth, `SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` for the
//!     others [design: wgpu-hal 30.0.1 `vulkan/conv.rs:240-260`, cited in `evaluate.rs`]).
//!     Nothing after the UI and Bevy's upscaling blit touches them before the present. Other
//!     frames tag all three as null [documented: `ProgrammingGuideDLSS_G.md` §5.2, null tags in
//!     menus and loading].
//!   - [`options`] (an exclusive system at the end of the render graph, so on the render thread
//!     just before Bevy's `render_system` presents): `slDLSSGSetOptions` only when what it
//!     should be changes: `eOn` from the first tagged play frame, `eOff` (resources kept) on a
//!     frame that is not, the sizes (depth and motion at the render size, colour at the
//!     output size), the back buffers left to DLSS-G (0). A call that fails is
//!     made again next frame. The options take effect at the next present, deterministically
//!     only when set on the presenting thread [documented: `ProgrammingGuideDLSS_G.md` §6.0].
//!   - [`state`] (an exclusive system right after `render_system`, the thread that presented):
//!     `slDLSSGGetState` after every present (null options: no VRAM estimate, which is
//!     expensive [documented: §13, §15]); `numFramesActuallyPresented` is the frames presented
//!     for that real frame [documented: §13], the generated ones added to
//!     `crate::frame_gen::GeneratedFrames` (the performance overlay's count); a line every ten
//!     seconds with real and presented frames; a status other than `eOk` while on turns frame
//!     generation off for the session, said once with the flags' names [documented: §14.3].
//! - **UI buffer** ([`ui_buffer`], stage 4 item 2; after the UI, before Bevy's upscaling blit,
//!   where FSR's frame generation's `generate` sits): on a tagged frame a full-screen pass writes
//!   a display-sized `R8Unorm` UI alpha from the frame (with the UI) and its HUD-less copy: 1
//!   where they differ, 0 elsewhere. With alpha 1 the UI's colour is the frame's, so the guide's
//!   rules hold: 0 where there is no UI, above 0 where there is, and `Final = UI.RGB + (1 -
//!   UI.A) * Hudless` [documented: `ProgrammingGuideDLSS_G.md` §5.1, "UI Alpha OR UI Color and
//!   Alpha"; UI alpha is the preferred, faster one], at the cost of taking a see-through HUD
//!   pixel as opaque UI (AMD's HUD-less mode in FSR's frame generation makes the same choice,
//!   `crate::frame_gen`). It is tagged `kBufferTypeUIAlpha` `eValidUntilPresent`, and the
//!   options ask for user interface recomposition, which needs the HUD-less and the UI alpha
//!   ("If both Hudless and UI alpha are tagged, you can also enable user interface
//!   recomposition", §5.1; §6.6). Not asked for: `eEnableFullscreenMenuDetection` (§6.5, which
//!   needs `kBufferTypeUIColorAndAlpha`): the mode goes off in every menu, loading and pause
//!   already (`may_generate`). While DLSS-G is unloaded (the live toggle) the HUD-less and UI
//!   textures are freed.
//! - **Window changes** ([`window_changes`], stage 4, an exclusive system before Bevy's
//!   `create_surfaces`): DLSS-G must be off before the swapchain is resized or its present mode
//!   changes [documented: `ProgrammingGuideDLSS_G.md` §12.0, §17]. When a window change is
//!   pending (`SurfaceData::reconfigure_pending`) while DLSS-G was on at the last present, the
//!   surface's reconfigure is held (the vendored `HoldSurfaceReconfigure`), the mode set off
//!   for this frame and presented once; on the next frame, with the last present off, the hold
//!   is released and Bevy reconfigures with the mode still off; frame generation comes back on
//!   the frame after. At most [`MAX_HOLD`] frames are held (a window that is never presented,
//!   minimised, would hold it for ever).
//!   What this meets of "off before any window manipulation" (§17): the OS window has already
//!   changed when the change reaches the render world (winit resized it, Bevy extracted the new
//!   size), so DLSS-G is still on while the OS resizes, maximises or changes the display mode;
//!   what the hold covers is the swapchain's reconfigure, which happens only after a frame was
//!   presented with the mode off. A hold whose image comes back `Outdated` presents nothing;
//!   no present since the mode went off counts as off ([`state`]).
//! - **On and off live** (`NVF_DLSSG_TOGGLE=<s>:off,<s>:on`, a test aid, seconds since the
//!   start): "the swap chain must be torn down and recreated every time DLSS-G is switched on
//!   or off" [documented: §18.0]. Off: the mode set off and presented once; then, in the next
//!   frame's extraction ([`toggle_switch`]: the main thread is extracting and the render thread
//!   waits, so neither calls Vulkan meanwhile, and the main thread's Reflex calls come after the
//!   extraction, `anti_lag.rs`), the GPU drained, the window's image dropped and its surface
//!   released (Bevy's `SurfaceData` taken away; wgpu waits for the device and destroys the
//!   swapchain and the surface when the last reference goes, wgpu-hal
//!   `Swapchain::release_resources`), DLSS-G's resources freed (`slFreeResources`, as for a
//!   long-term off, §6.4), `slSetFeatureLoaded(DLSS-G, false)`, and Bevy's `create_surfaces`
//!   makes the surface and swapchain again that frame, now native. On: the same with `true` and
//!   nothing to free, so the new swapchain is Streamline's proxy. A reconfigure alone would not
//!   do: wgpu makes the new swapchain before it destroys the old one. Not covered: Bevy compiles
//!   pipelines on task threads, which may create Vulkan pipelines during the switch (no queue or
//!   swapchain call; `slSetFeatureLoaded` asks for no Vulkan call at all in parallel,
//!   `sl_core_api.h:130-131`) [hypothesis: harmless, as no swapchain or queue object is touched].
//!   While DLSS-G is unloaded frame generation does not run (`super::frame_generation_running`):
//!   vsync and the frame cap are frame pacing's again.
//! - **Exit** ([`exit_watch`], in the extraction before Bevy's `extract_windows`): on `AppExit`
//!   the mode is set off for the frame being extracted, which is still presented; on a window
//!   closing the mode is set off at once (`extract_windows` queues the surface's removal, which
//!   Bevy applies at the render world's `ExtractCommands`, before that frame renders).
//! - **Errors**: with DLSS-G loaded, `vkQueuePresentKHR` and `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` run
//!   asynchronously inside Streamline and the host sees only "the last known error"; the
//!   callback reports each call whose `VkResult` is not `VK_SUCCESS` and must return at once
//!   [documented: §6.7; `sl_core_types.h:516-517`]. It stores the value in atomics: errors
//!   (negative), the swapchain out of date or suboptimal (`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR`,
//!   `VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR`: a resize, answered by a reconfigure) and other positive results apart.
//!
//! Every system here runs only while DLSS-G is installed ([`active`], a static flag, so without
//! the spike nothing is locked or called). The DLSS-G functions are "NOT thread safe"
//! (`sl_dlss_g.h:187-208`) and are called only from the exclusive systems, which run on the
//! render thread (exclusive systems run on the thread that runs the schedule, and Bevy's
//! `render_system`, itself exclusive, runs the render graph's schedule there).
