//! DLSS through NVIDIA Streamline (#2198): Streamline's interposer loaded and initialised, the
//! Vulkan instance made through it, DLSS's support checked, DLSS Super Resolution in every mode
//! drawing a camera in its own pass (`evaluate.rs`), and Streamline shut down in order at exit.
//! The loader runs when the start-up choice is DLSS (the settings' Upscaler row or the command
//! line) or the four files are in the folder ([`bundle_present`], a cheap existence check), on
//! Windows with Vulkan among the renderer's backends, so with the files there every switch of
//! the upscaler is live (`upscaler::UpscalerStartup`); the test aid `NVF_DLSS_PRELOAD=1` runs
//! it always, `=0` only for a DLSS choice. `main` adds [`DlssInitPlugin`] only then (otherwise
//! nothing is loaded or logged here).
//!
//! - **Files** [design]: `<program folder>\dlss\` (or `NVF_DLSS_DIR=<absolute path>`) holding
//!   `sl.interposer.dll`, `sl.common.dll`, `sl.dlss.dll` and `nvngx_dlss.dll`; with any missing,
//!   the stock path and one line saying which. NVForever ships none of them.
//! - **Start** (before `DefaultPlugins`, Windows only, and only when the renderer's backends
//!   include Vulkan, as Bevy picks them from `WGPU_BACKEND`): the interposer's signature checked
//!   (`security.rs`), the library loaded by full path and kept for the process, `slInit` with
//!   Vulkan, DLSS, the folder as the plugin path, the over-the-air flags off and an engine
//!   version and project id (without both Streamline keeps NGX off when no NVIDIA application
//!   id is given [documented: `src/commonEntry.cpp:1494-1535`]). Then Bevy's raw Vulkan init is
//!   told to make the instance from the interposer (vendored bevy_render,
//!   `RawVulkanInitSettings::set_vulkan_library`). Any failure: today's path.
//! - **Preflight** (`preflight.rs`): the folder is listed before the interposer is loaded and
//!   again just before `slInit`; an `nvngx_update.exe` in it, in any case, or a folder that
//!   cannot be listed keeps Streamline out (Streamline would start that file unchecked), and so
//!   do a folder or DLL that is a link, a release DLL with another hash, an `nvngx_*.dll` not
//!   signed by NVIDIA, or any other DLL. The checked files stay open until the shutdown. Every
//!   GPU Vulkan exposes, of any kind, is read through the system's Vulkan loader before the
//!   interposer is loaded, and after `slInit` checked against `slGetFeatureRequirements(DLSS)`
//!   plus what Streamline's `vkCreateDevice` always adds: Bevy can fall back from any adapter
//!   it is asked for to wgpu's own pick [documented: vendor/bevy_render/src/renderer/mod.rs:
//!   166-194, 304], so no GPU is left out. Any GPU short of it, or none at all, and `slShutdown`
//!   runs and the stock path follows, before `set_vulkan_library`.
//!   [`loader_state`] says what the loader ended in.
//!   Clearing the two update flags does not stop Streamline starting NVIDIA's updater, and a
//!   driver override can still pick downloaded plugins [documented: `src/pluginManager.cpp:
//!   966-968, 994-1005`]; watch for that in runs.
//! - **Rollback**: if the instance cannot be made from the interposer after `slInit` worked,
//!   `slShutdown` runs before the renderer falls back to the system's loader, and DLSS
//!   stays off. There is no fallback once the device is being made: wgpu-hal panics when
//!   Streamline's device proxy refuses for missing extensions [documented: wgpu-hal 30.0.1
//!   `vulkan/adapter.rs:3044-3050`].
//! - **Adapter pin** (after the device check, `preflight::pin`): when `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` is
//!   unset and exactly one checked GPU is NVIDIA's and its name picks it alone, the renderer is
//!   asked for it by name ([`render_plugin`], Bevy's `WgpuSettings::adapter_name`). That only
//!   prefers the NVIDIA GPU among the checked ones (Bevy takes its own pick when no adapter of
//!   that name supports the window's surface); what keeps the renderer off an unchecked GPU is that the device
//!   check covers every GPU Vulkan exposes. Once the device exists the GPU Bevy chose is
//!   compared with the checked one (name and LUID); a mismatch keeps DLSS off.
//! - **Support** (once the device exists, `Plugin::cleanup`): `slIsFeatureSupported` with the
//!   physical device and its LUID (Streamline skips the adapter check without a LUID
//!   [documented: `src/sl.cpp:855-860`]), the versions Streamline reports, and the evidence that
//!   the device came through its proxies (the instance marker; Streamline's own log lines).
//!   With DLSS supported, its two functions fetched and the adapter as checked, DLSS is
//!   **active** ([`loader_state`] `Ready`).
//! - **Which camera** [design]: the one the graphics settings give `upscaler::DlssUpscaling`,
//!   which they do while DLSS is the effective choice (`upscaler::resolve`, from the requested
//!   choice and this session's facts: [`session_state`], [`streamline_loaded`]). Cameras with
//!   `fsr::FsrUpscaling` are FSR's; nothing here touches them.
//! - **Sizes** (`sizing.rs`): the view preparation (`upscaler::prep::prepare`) asks
//!   `slDLSSGetOptimalSettings` for the mode, output size and HDR-ness, once per change, and
//!   draws at the size DLSS reports, with DLSS's jitter phases and mip bias.
//! - **Options** ([`configure`], a render system after the view preparation, before anything of
//!   the frame is recorded): `slDLSSSetOptions` when the mode, output size, HDR-ness or the DLSS
//!   model (the settings' DLSS model row, `Graphics::dlss_model`, [`DlssMainState`]) changes;
//!   when DLSS may already hold resources for the viewport, the GPU is drained (`Device::poll`
//!   wait) and `slFreeResources` runs first, so no feature is released while the GPU may still
//!   use it (Streamline itself releases a replaced feature three frames later [documented:
//!   `src/dlssEntry.cpp:357-369`]). When DLSS stops drawing (the effective upscaler is FSR or
//!   off) with options set, the same drain and `slFreeResources` free its resources at once
//!   rather than at the shutdown, and the next DLSS frame sets the options again.
//! - **Evaluate** ([`dlss_pass`], DLSS's own pass, where `fsr::fsr_pass` sits for FSR: after the
//!   ambient occlusion, before bloom, the bright pass and the other full-resolution effects): the
//!   common corrected depth, one DLSS evaluate (`evaluate.rs` says the order), the scene's alpha
//!   restored where a shape marks it, the depth expanded. No FSR state is made for it. Any
//!   failure: the common spatial fallback draws that frame and the history is invalidated;
//!   [`FAILED_FRAMES`] frames running without DLSS's output and DLSS is unavailable for the
//!   session ([`session_state`]): the status then draws the camera natively. FSR's frame
//!   generation never runs on a DLSS camera (`frame_gen::usable` asks for FSR drawing).
//! - **Output proof** (`evaluate.rs` `OutputProof`): `slEvaluateFeature` answers `eOk` even
//!   when NGX's evaluate failed (Streamline's DLSS plugin ignores NGX's result [documented:
//!   `src/dlssEntry.cpp:738`]), so a call that worked is not output. Once per generation of
//!   DLSS's options (each `slDLSSSetOptions`: the start, a mode change, a resize) a grid of the
//!   output's texels is read back asynchronously right after the evaluate, before anything
//!   else writes the output, which is cleared to black just before the evaluate: finite RGB
//!   that is not all zero can only be DLSS's (`output observed`); all black is inconclusive (a
//!   black scene looks the same) and is tried again later, a bounded number of times. Beside
//!   it, the lines `sl.common` logs when NGX's evaluate fails (`NGX evaluate feature ...
//!   failed` [documented: `src/commonEntry.cpp:792, 1047`]) are latched from Streamline's log
//!   callback (`note_ngx_line`) and each counts as a frame without DLSS's output toward
//!   [`FAILED_FRAMES`]. Neither proves image quality (motion, stability): that still takes
//!   pictures and movement [design: the plan's risk P2].
//! - **Shutdown** ([`shutdown`], from `main` after `App::run` returns): by then the app,
//!   its render world and its render thread are gone (Bevy waits for the render app to come back
//!   before dropping it [design: vendor/bevy_render/src/pipelined_rendering.rs:67-80]), but the
//!   loader still holds its own clones of the device, queue, adapter and instance, so the Vulkan
//!   device and instance are alive. The GPU is drained (`Device::poll` wait, then
//!   `vkDeviceWaitIdle`), DLSS's resources for the viewport are freed (`slFreeResources`, which
//!   needs pending evaluates flushed [documented: `sl_core_api.h:233-237`]), `slShutdown` runs, and only then are the clones dropped, the last
//!   handles, so the device and instance are destroyed after it. Streamline's cleanup uses the
//!   device it stored [documented: `src/vulkan.cpp:1349-1407`]. Then the DLSS folder's checked
//!   files, held open since the folder pass (`win.rs` `Pins`), are released. The interposer stays
//!   loaded.
//!
//! - **Frame generation** (#2317; docs/design/dlss-frame-generation.md): with the four files of
//!   [`FG_FILES`] in the folder beside the four above, `slInit` asks for DLSS, DLSS Frame
//!   Generation and Reflex with frame-based tagging; DLSS-G's and Reflex's requirements are
//!   logged and merged into the device check, and when that or `slInit` fails, Streamline is shut
//!   down and initialised again with DLSS alone. Without the four files DLSS runs as before (one
//!   line says which are missing). Once the device exists, DLSS-G stays loaded when the start's
//!   Frame generation choice is DLSS and is unloaded before the window's swapchain otherwise;
//!   Reflex stays loaded, and NVIDIA low latency goes through it ([`frame_generation_on`],
//!   `nv_low_latency.rs`). `frame_gen.rs` follows the Frame generation row (on, off, the frames
//!   to generate), sets the constants once a frame for FSR or DLSS, tags the depth, motion, a
//!   copy of the frame without the HUD and a UI alpha on frames that may be generated, sets
//!   DLSS-G's options on changes, reads its state after every present, holds a window change
//!   until a frame was presented with DLSS-G off, and loads or unloads DLSS-G live with the
//!   swapchain made again; `frame_token.rs` gives every Streamline call our frame number.
//!   FSR's frame generation never runs while DLSS-G is loaded (`crate::frame_gen::usable`).
//!
//! Log lines start `DLSS:` (`DLSS-G:` for frame generation's own); lines before the log is up
//! wait in a buffer, written each frame (`First`) and at shutdown.
