//! The temporal upscaler choice shared by FSR 3.1 (`fsr.rs`) and DLSS (`dlss/`), #2198
//! (docs/design/dlss-upscaling.md, "Internal interfaces").
//!
//! - [`UpscalerChoice`] is what the player asks for: off, FSR at a quality or DLSS at a quality.
//!   It is the one requested setting, `Graphics::upscaler`; FSR's call sites read it through
//!   `Graphics::fsr` and write it through `Graphics::set_fsr`.
//! - [`UpscaleQuality`] is the quality list both upscalers use (`fsr::FsrQuality` is an alias;
//!   FSR's ratios stay in `fsr.rs`, DLSS's sizes come from DLSS).
//! - [`UpscalerStatus`] is what this session can do and what it draws: the **effective** choice,
//!   whether a **restart is pending**, and why a request cannot run ([`Unavailable`]).
//!   [`resolve`] is its rule [design]: Streamline is loaded at start whenever NVIDIA's files are
//!   in the DLSS folder (or DLSS is chosen), so with it loaded off, FSR and DLSS all switch at
//!   once (FSR then draws through the interposer). A restart is pending only for DLSS asked for
//!   in a session that started without Streamline while the files are there now (they were
//!   added since, or the test aid `NVF_DLSS_PRELOAD=0` kept it out); until then what drew stays.
//!
//! - [`prep`] is the view preparation every temporal upscaler shares (step 4): camera history
//!   and cuts, the render-size override, jitter and mip bias, the corrected and expanded depth,
//!   the spatial fallback and the alpha copy. FSR adds its own state after it; DLSS gets it
//!   without any of FSR's.
//! - [`temporal_active`] is the question the shared parts ask (HDR, prepasses, cut-outs drawn
//!   alpha-tested, the anti-aliasing lock, the ambient occlusion at the render size), where
//!   `graphics::fsr_active` stays FSR's own (its sharpening, frame generation). Both go by the
//!   effective choice ([`effective`]).
//!
//! **Start** (step 8) [design]: the requested choice is the command line's
//! ([`command_line_choice`]: `--upscaler`, `--upscaler-quality`, the older `--fsr`), then the
//! settings' INI by the settings' own precedence (`settings::upscaler_after_ini`), read in
//! `main` before the renderer exists, because Streamline must be loaded before the Vulkan
//! instance is made. [`UpscalerStartup`] decides whether the DLSS loader runs: a DLSS choice,
//! or the four files in the DLSS folder (a cheap existence check, `dlss::bundle_present`; the
//! loader's own checks still decide), on Windows with Vulkan among the renderer's backends.
//! The test aid `NVF_DLSS_PRELOAD=1` always loads it, `=0` only for a DLSS choice. The same INI
//! lines are applied again with the other rows at `PostStartup`; both read them by the rows'
//! own rules, so they agree. [`follow_request`] then keeps the status.
