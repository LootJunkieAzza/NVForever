//! NPCs throwing grenades (docs/design/combat-ai.md §20). No page says when the
//! original's actors throw one: the combat style has no grenade field and FalloutNV.esm
//! sets no such setting [observed: CSTY's fields, the GMSTs named Grenade or Throw];
//! combat is not a parity target (docs/design/combat.md), so the rules are ours [design]:
//!
//! - **What**: a weapon of animation type "Grenade Throw (1 Hand)" whose projectile
//!   explodes (frag, plasma and pulse grenades, dynamite), from the actor's inventory, one
//!   used up per throw: unlike guns, which load rounds from nowhere (owner 2026-10-17),
//!   a grenade thrown is gone, so a fighter carries as many throws as grenades.
//! - **When**: a gunman (not a melee fighter, not fleeing) that is ready to fire on a
//!   target it sees, first [`FIRST_AFTER`] seconds into seeing it, then every
//!   [`BETWEEN`] seconds; only at a target beyond [`MIN_BLAST_SHARE`] times the blast's
//!   radius (it keeps clear of its own blast) and its throw's reach (the low arc's, under
//!   the projectile's gravity, no farther than [`MAX_THROW`]); held, as an explosive shot
//!   is, when a comrade or a bystander would be caught (combat-ai.md §17.6).
//! - **How**: from its eyes on the low arc that lands on the target's feet (as VATS
//!   mode's throws, `fnv_combat::vats::lob_dir`), the grenade's throw clip played, its
//!   FireExplosive line tried (`fnv_game::combat_lines`), the shot's own explosion and
//!   the others' running from it as for the player's grenades (§17.7). The gun stays in
//!   its hand meanwhile [design: no weapon swap for one throw].
