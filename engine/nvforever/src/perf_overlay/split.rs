//! The frame split row's times: what a frame took on the main thread, on the render
//! thread and on the GPU, so a frame held up by the CPU can be told from one held up by
//! the GPU (issue #1868). Each is the mean over the readout's window
//! (`readings::WINDOW`) of what each frame took [design]:
//!
//! - **main**: the main schedule's run, from the start of `First` (before the clocks'
//!   update, `bevy::time::TimeSystems`) to `Last`, before the frame rate limit's wait
//!   (`frame_pace::cap_rate`): the game's own systems. It leaves out the wait for the
//!   render thread at extraction and the window events, which come between two runs of
//!   the schedule [design: bevy_render 0.20.1 `pipelined_rendering.rs`, the main app
//!   hands its world to the render thread after `Last`]; so `main` is what the main
//!   thread worked, not the frame's time.
//! - **render**: the render world's whole `Render` schedule, from before its first system
//!   set (`RenderSystems::ExtractCommands`) to after its last (`RenderSystems::PostCleanup`),
//!   on the render thread (pipelined rendering). It includes the wait for the window's
//!   next image (`prepare_windows`, vendor/bevy_render `view/window/mod.rs`: its
//!   `get_current_texture` can wait long while the GPU is behind), which is shown on its
//!   own as **wait**: the span from just before `prepare_windows` to just after it. Other
//!   prepare systems run beside `prepare_windows`, so render less the wait would
//!   understate the render thread's work; the row shows both instead, and with vsync the
//!   wait is the display's time. GPU time is what tells a GPU-bound frame.
//! - **GPU**: the sum of the top-level render passes' GPU times from GPU timestamp
//!   queries, as Bevy's render diagnostics give them (`RenderDiagnosticsPlugin`,
//!   `readings::gpu_frame_ms`), each the mean of its measurements since the row began to
//!   show ([`mean_since`]), so an earlier showing's are never in it. Passes Bevy does not
//!   time (the shadow passes, `graphics.rs`) are not in it, so it is a lower bound of the
//!   GPU's frame. The plugin can only be added when the app is built: it is added at the
//!   start when the INI, applied as the settings will apply it, has the split row and the
//!   overlay on ([`timestamps_wanted`]); a row switched on later shows the GPU part from
//!   the next start. Without timestamp queries on the device, or without the plugin, the
//!   GPU part is left out.
//!
//! Timestamps cost a little GPU time and a read-back each frame. When the overlay alone
//! added the plugin, its recorder (`DiagnosticsRecorder`) is taken out of the render world
//! while the row is not shown ([`gate_recorder`]): the passes record nothing without it
//! (`RenderContext::diagnostic_recorder` is optional) and the plugin's own systems do
//! nothing (vendor/README.md, bevy_render's recorder gate). When a measuring path asked
//! for the diagnostics too (`graphics::MeasuringDiagnostics`: the frame-time aid, frame
//! telemetry's `gpu`, the span profile; or Bevy added them itself, with Tracy) the
//! recorder stays [design].
//!
//! While the row is off (or the overlay hidden) the stamping systems return at once:
//! nothing is timed or kept. Each showing of the row has a generation ([`Clock::set_on`]):
//! a span is tagged with the generation it began in and is dropped when it ends in
//! another, so a span under way across a hide and a show is not in the new showing, as
//! `usage.rs` does for the sampler's collections.
