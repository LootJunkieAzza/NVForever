//! How actors look while they fight (docs/design/combat-ai.md §9): NPCs aim at their
//! target and play an attack clip with every shot and blow; creatures play a bite or
//! swipe with every blow. The decisions are `npc_combat.rs`'s ([`PlayAttack`]); this
//! module finds the clips, and `locomotion::drive` lays them over what the actor plays
//! otherwise ([`CombatPose::layers`]).
//!
//! - **Aiming.** An NPC in a fight with its weapon drawn bends to its target's height:
//!   its stance's level aim clip (`2hraim.kf`, played by `weapons.rs`) mixed with the
//!   up or down form (`2hraimup.kf`, `2hraimdown.kf`) by the pitch from its eyes to the
//!   target's chest, as the player's body does (`fnv_actor::player_clips::aim_weights`,
//!   docs/spec-notes/animation.md §9.6: the forms are the poses at ±90°) [hypothesis, as
//!   there].
//! - **Shots and blows of NPCs.** The weapon's attack clip, chosen as the player's is
//!   (`player_clips::attack_stem` of the WEAP attack animation, then `attack_clips`:
//!   `2hrattack3.kf`, `1hpattackright.kf`, `h2hattackright_a.kf` …), in the skeleton's
//!   folder, with its own up or down form at the aim's weight (§9.6: "an attack plays
//!   with its own up and down forms"). Fists are `h2h`.
//! - **Creatures' blows.** The creature's own `h2hattack….kf` clips in its skeleton's
//!   folder (the dog's `h2hattackleft.kf` and `h2hattackright.kf`, the radscorpion's
//!   `h2hattackleft_mid.kf` …) [observed: the base meshes archive, 2026-10-11], power and
//!   forward attacks left out, taken in turn [design]; a blow that goes on a combo takes
//!   the clip its last clip's `a:` key named first, where the creature has one. A power
//!   attack `npc_combat` asks for ([`Power`]) plays its own clip: the radscorpion's sting
//!   is `h2hattackpower.kf` and `h2hattackforwardpower.kf` [observed: the base meshes
//!   archive, 2026-10-16]. Which power attacks a creature has clips for, and when each
//!   lands, are told to `npc_combat` ([`AttackTimes::powers`]).
//! - **Melee combos** (`fnv_combat::melee`, as the player's swings): a blow carries a
//!   [`SwingPick`], the attack group the last swing's `a:` text key named (`a:L` on
//!   `AttackRight` clips, `a:R` on `AttackLeft` ones [observed, `fnv_combat::melee`]) or
//!   none for a run's first swing, which plays the weapon's own attack group; each swing
//!   takes its `_a` or `_b` form by a roll. The started clip's `Hit` key, `a:` key and
//!   length go back to `npc_combat` ([`AttackTimes::swings`]), which decides at the `a:`
//!   key whether to go on (docs/design/combat-ai.md §15).
//! - **When a blow lands**: at the clip's `Hit` text key [documented:
//!   NiTextKeyExtraData; observed: 931 `hit` keys in the clips, animation.md §3.2]; the
//!   key's time is told to `npc_combat` ([`AttackTimes`]), which delays the blow's damage
//!   by it. Shots leave at the start of their clip [design].
//! - **Automatic fire with a looping clip** (`2hhattackspin.kf` of the minigun, flamer and
//!   gatling laser: `Fire` and `Loop` keys, animation.md §9.8): the first shot starts the
//!   clip at its `Fire` key (NPCs do not spin up first [design]), the shots that follow
//!   while it runs do not start it again, and it goes round from `Fire` to `Loop` while
//!   they come no more than [`LOOP_HOLD`] apart, then plays out from where it is, as the
//!   player's body does. Started again at every shot, it jerked the arms and shoulders
//!   back to its start many times a second [observed in NVForever: owner's playtest
//!   2026-10-16, Cook-Cook's flamer].
//! - **Reloads of NPCs** (`npc_combat` asks with [`Move::Reload`] and
//!   [`Move::ReloadRound`]): the weapon's reload clip as the player's body plays it
//!   (`player_clips::reload_clips` of the WEAP reload animation: `1hpreloada.kf`,
//!   crouched first), on the attack layers over the level aim without up or down forms;
//!   a weapon that loads round by round (`1hpreloadxstart.kf` beside `1hpreloadx.kf`:
//!   the .357 revolver, lever-actions) plays its opening clip, then the reload clip from
//!   its start for each round, without a fade in, running on past its `Hit` key to close
//!   (docs/spec-notes/combat-rules.md §4). The clips' lengths and `Hit` key in the
//!   actor's own rig go to `npc_combat` ([`AttackTimes::reloads`]), whose gun cycle
//!   reloads for as long. Their `Sound:` keys play as any clip's (`anim_sounds`).
//! - While an attack clip plays, the actor's body block keeps the place it had when the
//!   attack began (`nvf_play::blocking::ActorBlocks::attacking`): a dog's lunge shoved
//!   the player back 40 units each bite before [design; owner 2026-10-11].
//! - An attack clip is laid on blend layers 4 and 5 (the idles' layers: an idle stops for
//!   the attack) over the aim, by track priority (attack clips 55, aim 50,
//!   animation.md §9.6); the aim's up or down form takes layer 3 when the weapon's draw
//!   cycle is not fading there [design].
//! - **Crouched, blocking** (docs/design/combat-ai.md §14): a crouched NPC's aim, its up
//!   and down forms, its sights and its attack clips are the crouched ones
//!   (`sneak2hraim.kf`, `sneak2hraimis.kf`, `sneak2hrattack3.kf` …), the standing ones
//!   where a stance has none; a blocking NPC holds `{prefix}blockidle.kf` (fists:
//!   `mtblockidle.kf`) in place of the level aim, without its up or down form; a blow it
//!   blocks plays `{prefix}blockhit.kf`, and the attacker whose blow was blocked plays
//!   `{prefix}recoil.kf` [observed: the base meshes archive has them for `1hm`, `2hm`
//!   and the unarmed `mt`/`h2h`].
