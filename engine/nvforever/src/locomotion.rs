//! Locomotion playback on actors (workstream 5 part G, docs/spec-notes/actors.md §8):
//! each animated actor carries its clip set and a [`Blend`] state; every frame the move
//! is chosen from its velocity and turn rate (`fnv_actor::locomotion::choose`) and up to
//! two clips are blended onto its skeleton (`nvf_assets::anim_play::BlendPlayer`).
//! Actors are moved by the test aid `--actor-walk-test` ([`WalkTest`]) and by `nav.rs`
//! (travellers on the navmesh); Layer 6 will set [`Locomotion::velocity`] and
//! [`Locomotion::turn`] from AI. A standing actor is turned on the spot by [`TurnTo`]
//! (actors.md §8.9), which plays its turn clip; `--actor-turn-test` ([`TurnTest`]) tries it.
