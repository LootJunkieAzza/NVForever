//! The Pip-Boy's needle and knobs on the first-person arms (docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md §2):
//! `RadNeedle` follows the player's total rads, `TabKnob` the page's tab, and `ScrollKnob`
//! the list's row. All the numbers are here, so a closer capture can replace them.
//!
//! The needle (its two shapes) turns about its local Z through its origin, out of the dial,
//! and the wheel about its local X through its origin, its axle: their vertices lie around
//! their origins [observed: `fnvtool nif decode`]. The tab knob turns through its origin too,
//! about its node's Z, which is not its shape's ([`KNOB_SHAFT`]), and stands leaned off the
//! plate as the original's does ([`KNOB_LEAN_AXIS`]).
//! The model's X runs right across the device in the view and its Y up [observed: where the
//! nodes are against the shots]. The shapes are rigid, each a child of the bone it is
//! attached to, so an absolute `bind × rotation` on its own transform turns it, after the arm
//! is posed and before transforms propagate. No rotation accumulates, and a rebuilt rig's new
//! shapes take a bind of their own.
//!
//! Only the shapes this was measured on turn: rigid, and of the size they are in the game's
//! male and female arm ([`KNOWN`]). A replacement model can share the names with other
//! pivots, axes or skinning, so any other shape is left as it is, said once for each control
//! (`pipboy: <control> left still: ...`). Only the arms rig's shapes are tagged
//! (`player_body.rs`): the third-person model's controls stay still, and NPCs' arms are not
//! touched.
//!
//! Off the arm no reading comes: a control finishes travelling to the last one, then holds
//! [hypothesis: nothing was captured down]. The first reading is taken at once, so a loaded
//! game's needle does not sweep up. While the Pip-Boy is up the needle quivers a little about
//! where it rests ([`NEEDLE_QUIVER`]); the travel and the log are without the quiver.
