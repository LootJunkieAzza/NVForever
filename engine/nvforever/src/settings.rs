//! `nvf_play::settings` like every switch of the page).
//!
//! Left on the command line: what is fixed when the game starts (`--no-npc-packages`,
//! `--no-actors`, FaceGen, weapons, `--no-lodgen`), most numbers (`--radius`; the volumes
//! are the Sound tab, `nvf_play::audio_out::register_settings`)
//! and the test aids. The draw distances are sliders here, each a part of the
//! command line's distance (`draw_distance.rs`); the field of view, the frame-rate cap and the
//! anti-aliasing and shadow-filter choices are sliders whose steps are the choices.
