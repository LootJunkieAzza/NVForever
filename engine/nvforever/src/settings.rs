//! The renderer's switches on the pause menu's settings page (`nvf_play::settings`, drawn
//! by `nvf_play::pause`; `--play` only): the on/off choices of the command line that can
//! change while the game runs. Each reads and writes the state its module uses, so a
//! switch starts as the command line left it, then as `NVForever.ini` stored it (kept by
//! `nvf_play::settings` like every switch of the page), except that in a test run a
//! switch given on the command line keeps its state (`given_switches`, #1382).
//!
//! Left on the command line: what is fixed when the game starts (`--no-npc-packages`,
//! `--no-actors`, FaceGen, weapons, `--no-lodgen`), most numbers (`--radius`; the volumes
//! are the Sound tab, `nvf_play::audio_out::register_settings`)
//! and the test aids. The draw distances are sliders here, each a part of the
//! command line's distance (`draw_distance.rs`); the field of view, the frame-rate cap and the
//! anti-aliasing and shadow-filter choices are sliders whose steps are the choices.
