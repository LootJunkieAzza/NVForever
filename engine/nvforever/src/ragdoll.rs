//! Ragdolls of dead actors (docs/spec-notes/ragdoll.md §4): when an actor dies, the
//! Havok bodies and constraints of its skeleton (`fnv_collide::ragdoll`) become jointed
//! rigid bodies in the physics world (`fnv_phys::ragdoll`) at the pose the skeleton is
//! in, and from then on the bodies move the bones: the corpse drops and comes to rest.
//!
//! - `deaths.rs` marks a dead actor whose skeleton has a ragdoll with [`Corpse`].
//! - [`start`] puts the ragdoll in the world once the physics cell under the actor is
//!   loaded (until then the actor shows its death pose as before), and passes on the
//!   shoves of hits (`nvf_play::combat::ActorPush`), the killing one included.
//! - [`pose`] writes the bodies' poses to the bones after each physics step. Bones
//!   without a body (fingers, clavicles, twist bones) keep the pose they died in under
//!   their parent.
//! - Where a corpse came to rest is remembered by reference ([`Ragdolls::rest`]): a
//!   corpse whose ground unloads, or that is drawn again later, is put back there at rest
//!   instead of falling again [design: the original keeps corpse poses in its saves].
//! - A corpse that is hidden (a script disabled or deleted its reference) leaves the
//!   physics world.
//! - A corpse that gets under the terrain is lifted back above it (a guard, as for the
//!   player).
//! - A corpse whose ragdoll will not be built (bad data that breaks or empties the build)
//!   or that fell through the terrain once too often is shown dead as an actor without a
//!   ragdoll is ([`unbuilt`], #2347): its death pose, or laid on its back.
//! - A corpse in water rises and floats at the surface (`fnv_phys::buoyancy`); it is
//!   left moving for up to [`MAX_AWAKE_IN_WATER`] instead of [`MAX_AWAKE`] so that it
//!   gets there. A corpse put back at rest (or in the pose its reference stores) stays
//!   where it lay until a hit or a blast rouses it.
//! - The player's own body drops the same way when the player dies (`death_cam.rs`): its
//!   third-person rig carries a [`PlayerRig`] in place of an [`ActorRig`], so that the
//!   systems of placed actors (head tracking, hit volumes, outfits) leave it alone.
