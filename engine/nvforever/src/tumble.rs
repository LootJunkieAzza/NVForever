//! The weather's wind on loose bodies (docs/spec-notes/wind.md, issue #1401): the
//! tumbleweeds.
//!
//! - **Which bodies.** Those whose model's rigid body has Body Flags bit 0, "respond to
//!   wind" [documented: nif.xml bhkRigidBody]; of the base archive's 12,941 collision
//!   objects three set it: the tumbleweed (`clutter\tumbleweednv.nif`), the tumbleweed
//!   pile effect and Caesar's throne [observed: `fnvtool collide objects`, its `wind`
//!   column, 2026-11-06]. Chosen by that flag, never by a name (`fnv_phys`
//!   `PhysWorld::wind_refs`); only dynamic bodies are blown, and none indoors.
//! - **How.** Such a body starts awake when its cell loads. For its first [`GUST`] seconds
//!   awake its horizontal velocity is drawn towards the wind's, by at most [`WIND_ACCEL`]
//!   a second, so it rolls downwind and climbs what it can; then the gust is over and it
//!   is slowed by [`SETTLE`] a second until it rests and falls asleep. A body asleep is
//!   not woken by the wind; woken by something else (a shot, a push) it has a gust again
//!   [hypothesis fitted to o27_tumble, 2026-11-06:
//!   in the original the tumbleweeds near the player rolled at 100–200 units a second
//!   towards about 330° (north-north-west) after a load, came to rest within 5–17 s and
//!   stayed there for the next minute, in a dust storm too; one held on a slope kept
//!   rocking, more in the storm].
//! - **The wind.** Its direction is the trees' and the grass's (`crate::tree::wind_vector`),
//!   its speed [`SPEED_PER_WIND`] × the weather's DATA wind speed, faded across a weather
//!   change; none indoors.
//!
//! Log: `wind summary: …` at exit (bodies that respond to the wind, the most blown in one
//! frame, the longest way one went and where to, the most time a frame took).
