//! NPCs living by their AI packages (docs/design/actor-behaviour.md §5.4):
//! `--npc-packages ACTOR[,ACTOR…]` hands placed actors to `fnv_ai`, and
//! `--npc-packages all` every actor and creature of the cells loaded around the camera
//! and of the interiors their load doors lead to.
//! Each chooses its package by the hour (`fnv_game::ai`), walks to where the package
//! sends it over the nav graph (`nav.rs` builds it), through doors into other spaces,
//! and stays there until its package changes. They are drawn and animated like
//! `--npc-travel` travellers (`nav::show_actor`), and wait for doors that open in place.
//!
//! **Whose game state.** With `--play` the package choice is the game's own
//! (`nvf_play::script`): quests, script packages and deaths count, package scripts run
//! in the game, and actors stand still while a menu or a conversation holds the game.
//! Without `--play` it runs in a game state of its own, as authored (no quest started).
//!
//! **The clock** starts at the sky's hour. Without `--play` it runs at the sky's
//! `--time-scale`, or at the game's TimeScale (30, `--npc-timescale`) when the sky stands
//! still; unlike the sky's it does not stop indoors. With `--play` it is the game's own
//! calendar, which the simulation advances at the TimeScale global (`nvf_play::sim`);
//! this module only sets it to the sky's hour once, at the start.
//!
//! **Furniture** (`furniture.rs`). `fnv_ai` says what furniture an actor uses
//! (`Agent::using`): what its package gives it (`fnv_ai::goal::package_furniture`) or
//! what its sandbox chose (`fnv_ai::sandbox`: seats, beds at night, a seat for a meal).
//! The actor is told to sit ([`SitOn`]) once it is drawn; when it is to use something
//! else, or nothing, it is told to get up ([`GetUp`]) and its walk waits until it has.
//!
//! **Sandboxing** (`fnv_ai::sandbox`) is decided headless; here its walks are walked,
//! its seats sat on, and at an idle marker the actor stands facing the marker's way
//! (the marker's idles are not played yet).
//!
//! **Hours that pass in the Wait menu** (`nvf_play::wait`, docs/spec-notes/wait-menu.md
//! §7). The menu holds the game, so nobody walks while it is up; for each hour that
//! passes in it every actor chooses its package for the new hour (with the packages'
//! begin, end and change scripts) and walks as far as it would have in an hour of play,
//! headless on the navmesh ([`Core::pass_hours`]). When the menu closes the residents
//! are where their packages have them; one that was on furniture and is to be elsewhere
//! is off it at once. [engineering choice: what the original does is not sourced.]
//!
//! **Movement.** With `--play`, an actor walking where the collision world is loaded
//! (around the player) is moved by the character controller ([`PhysMover`]): it steers
//! along its path and physics decides where it ends up, so it goes round furniture and
//! follows the floor. Stuck for a few seconds, or anywhere else (other cells, other
//! spaces, without `--play`), it moves on the navmesh surface (`fnv_nav::Walker`).
//!
//! **Load doors** (`door_fade.rs`): an actor that goes through a door into another space
//! fades out at it and in at the other side, and the doors' open sounds play where the
//! listener is drawn (owner's playtest list 5 item 3).
