//! Clips that drive the materials of actors' parts: the Securitron's Idle (`mtidle.kf`)
//! flickers its screen's glow, scales and rolls the face now and then and scrolls the
//! white noise over it; `Talking` and the screen-change idle flash the screen
//! (docs/spec-notes/effects-animation-audit.md §2). The tracks name the parts' shapes
//! (`Screen01:0`, `ScreenStatic:0`), which carry their name (`ShapeName`) and stored look
//! (`StoredLook`), as do the shapes of the weapon it holds (`weapons.rs`: the glowing
//! bulbs of energy weapons in `1hpattack3.kf`).
//!
//! Each frame the values come from the playing layers of the actor's `BlendPlayer`, the
//! strongest layer per member (`nvf_assets::material_anim::actor_material_values`); a
//! member no layer drives any more goes back to what the model stores [hypothesis: the
//! game may leave it where the clip left it; the idle's values sit at the stored ones
//! most of the time]. Only the members a track drives are written, so a texture swap
//! (`SetSecuritronExpression`, `texture_swap.rs`), SetActorAlpha or a fade keep theirs.
//!
//! A shape gets its own copy of the material it wears when first driven; when another
//! system gives it a new one (a swapped texture), that is copied in turn. A shape drawn
//! see-through (`Faded`, `Fading`) already wears a copy of its own, which is written as
//! it is.
