//! Sky, sun, ambient light and fog from the worldspace's climate and weather at a time of
//! day (fnv_world::sky; hypotheses listed there, in docs/spec-notes/world.md §6 and in
//! docs/design/layer3.md).
//!
//! The sky is the game's own sky meshes around the camera [observed: `meshes\sky\`]:
//! - `atmosphere.nif`, a dome coloured by the weather's sky-upper, horizon and sky-lower
//!   colours: sky-upper weighted by the vertex colours' blue channel, horizon by a fitted
//!   function of elevation, mixed as display (sRGB) values (`dome_color`) [hypothesis,
//!   fitted to screenshots of the original game, docs/spec-notes/world.md §6 "Sky
//!   colours"; reading the green channel as the horizon weight gave the horizon colour far
//!   too much of the sky].
//! - `clouds.nif`, four cloud shapes whose vertex alpha fades them towards the horizon.
//!   The weather's cloud layers 0-3 (WTHR DNAM, CNAM, ANAM, BNAM textures and PNAM
//!   colours) go on the four shapes in file order [hypothesis: layer 0 is the top dome,
//!   which the night weather fills with a starfield; layer 3 the low dome, which the
//!   clear day weather fills with `NVCloudlight.dds`]. By day they take on part of the
//!   sunlight's hue (`SkyState::cloud_tint`) [hypothesis, fitted].
//! - The sun: the climate's sun texture and glare texture spread over angular squares
//!   around the sun, coloured by the weather's "sun" colour and drawn into the dome (the
//!   disc, behind the clouds) and the clouds (the glare) by sky.wgsl [hypothesis, fitted].
//! - The climate's night-sky model (CLMT MODL, `Sky\Stars.nif`, additive at
//!   `STAR_STRENGTH`, weighted by the star texture's alpha where its shader flags set
//!   Alpha_Texture),
//!   coloured by the weather's "stars" colour and faded in as the sun sinks from 0° to
//!   −12° (sunset to full dark) [hypothesis: the stars colour is white by day, so the
//!   weather alone does not hide them].
//! - A moon disc opposite the sun (where the night light comes from), textured
//!   `sky\masser_<phase>.dds` by the climate's phase length and the days passed, faded in
//!   as the sun goes from +5° to −6° [hypothesis].
//!
//! Every sky part uses `SkyMaterial` (sky.wgsl): its colour is a display value, mapped
//! through the inverse of the camera's tonemapper so the image-space grade sees the
//! weather's colours as the game's grade does; by day the sky is dimmed and warmed
//! (`SkyLight`) [hypothesis, fitted].
//!
//! Without those meshes the sky falls back to a sphere. The sun lights the world as a
//! directional light (colour "sunlight"), optionally with cascaded shadow maps. Ambient
//! light uses "ambient", fog "fog" with the weather's day/night distances; an unset range
//! (far not beyond near) takes the other one, and a weather with neither has no fog
//! [hypothesis, world.md §6].
