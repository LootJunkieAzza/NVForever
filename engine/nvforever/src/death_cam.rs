//! The death camera (owner request 2026-10-16): when the player dies the body drops as a
//! ragdoll, the view goes with it, the game slows down and the picture blurs.
//!
//! - **The body** (`ragdoll.rs`): the player's third-person rig is handed to its ragdoll
//!   ([`crate::ragdoll::PlayerRig`]) at the pose it died in, and its clips stop
//!   (`player_body.rs` leaves a dead player's body alone). It is drawn whole in both
//!   views, but for its head while the view is inside it.
//! - **First person**: the camera stays fixed to the head: where it was against the head
//!   bone when the player died, it stays, turning and falling with the head as the
//!   ragdoll drops.
//! - **Third person** (owner 2026-10-25: "don't reposition the camera, keep it where it
//!   is"): the camera stays where it was when the player died and only turns, to look at
//!   the body's chest over [`LOOK_IN`] and to keep looking at it if it slides or rolls.
//! - The first-person view is kept in front of walls and floors between the head and the
//!   camera (the third-person camera's rule, `nvf_play::control::place_camera`); both
//!   views are eased towards where they want to be over [`FOLLOW`] so that the ragdoll's
//!   small shakes do not shake the picture.
//! - Without a body (`--no-actors`) or a ragdoll for its skeleton the view sinks to the
//!   floor where the player stood, turning over onto its side in first person.
//! - **Slow motion**: the game clock (`nvf_play::script::ClockScale`, on top of
//!   SetGlobalTimeMultiplier) eases down to [`SLOW`] over [`SLOW_IN`], stays there until
//!   [`SLOW_END`] and comes back to full speed over [`SLOW_OUT`] (seconds of real time,
//!   menus excluded): the fall plays out at a quarter speed. Sounds slow with it, longer
//!   and lower (owner 2026-10-18, "like the base game"): at half speed, an octave down,
//!   while the clock is at [`SLOW`] (`nvf_play::audio_out::slowed_sound`); music and
//!   radio keep theirs.
//! - **Blur**: the picture blurs to radius [`BLUR`] (the image space modifiers' units,
//!   `imagespace.rs`) over [`BLUR_IN`] and stays blurred while the player is dead.
//!   `--death-imod <Editor ID or 0xFormID>` also plays that image space modifier when the
//!   player dies, as a script's ApplyImageSpaceModifier would.
//! - **Fade to black** (owner, todo 6 item 3, 2026-10-17): [`FADE_DELAY`] real seconds
//!   after the death the screen starts to go black, slowly, and is black [`FADE_SECONDS`]
//!   later; it stays black while the player is dead. Real seconds, menus excluded, like
//!   the blur: the slow motion does not stretch it. It is drawn over the blur and over
//!   whatever fade a modifier puts on the screen (`imagespace.rs`, as sleeping's fade).
//! - The player alive again (a save loaded, a script resurrecting): the ragdoll leaves
//!   the world, the body and the view are the player's again and the clock runs at full
//!   speed.
//!
//! Every constant here is [design]: how the original's death camera moves, how slow its
//! slow motion is and which image space modifier it plays, if any, are not known; the
//! fade's timing is the owner's. The original reloads the last save some seconds after
//! the death; that is not built, and how long the original waits, and whether it fades,
//! is not in our notes.
//!
//! Log lines: `death camera: the player died in first person: …` when it starts,
//! `death camera: the body is on the ground …` when the ragdoll comes to rest,
//! `death camera: the screen starts fading to black …` and `death camera: the screen is
//! black …` for the fade, and
//! `death camera: the player lives again …` when it ends.
