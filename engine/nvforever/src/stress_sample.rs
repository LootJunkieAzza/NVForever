//! and `stress actors: <n> drawn in <f> frames (<ms> ms, most in a frame <m> ms); those
//! frames mean <m> ms, worst <w> ms, <k> over 100 ms`.
//!
//! The frame measured (issue #1415): a frame is the time between two consecutive runs of
//! the sampler in `First`, each run a frame boundary. Each boundary takes its own instant
//! (`Instant::now()`), the phase it sees (start-up, behind a loading screen, seen), the
//! streamer's and `readahead::clock`'s counters and the place. A frame's time is the
//! difference between its two boundaries' instants, its cell and actor counts the counters'
//! differences, its phase the one both boundaries saw: time, phase, counts and place all
//! come from the same two boundaries ([`Samples::step`], [`frame`]). The time is the main
//! thread's whole loop from one `First` to the next: the frame's schedules, the wait for
//! the render thread's previous frame at extraction, extraction itself and the window
//! events [design: bevy_render 0.20.1 `pipelined_rendering.rs:115-136`].
//!
//! It is not `Time<Real>`'s delta, which the sampler used before issue #1415. That clock
//! takes the instant the render world sends after its render schedule [design: bevy_render
//! 0.20.1 `lib.rs:464,522-524`], received in `First` or `Instant::now()` when none is queued
//! [design: bevy_time 0.20.1 `lib.rs:163,180`]. With pipelined rendering (in bevy's default
//! plugins, which `main.rs` keeps [design: bevy_internal 0.20.1 `default_plugins.rs:56-57`])
//! the delta that arrives at a boundary can be the frame before's, so a long frame a loading
//! screen came down in could arrive one boundary late, when both boundaries saw the screen
//! down, and be counted as a seen hitch at the destination [design: code reading, not
//! reproduced live]. The first boundary has none before it: it only sets the baseline (in
//! start-up), no frame is counted for it.
//!
//! A frame whose two boundaries saw different phases (a loading screen went up or came down
//! in it, `loading::finish` in `Last` included) crossed a phase change: it is in no frame
//! time, and when slow it is logged as `stress hitch (across a phase change, <from> to
//! <to>): …, from <place> to <place>` with its raw duration, without saying whether the
//! loading or the game took it. Each sample window counts its start-up, hidden and crossing
//! frames and its real length (`startup frames`, `hidden frames`, `phase changes`, `window
//! <ms> ms`, before the place), so a window that held a transition can be told from a clean
//! one, and the window starts again when start-up ends. A line's `t` is its boundary's
//! instant on `Time<Real>`'s clock (seconds from that clock's first update).
//!
//! Start-up (the frames until the start's cells are all in, `Streamer::settled`; the Startup
//! schedules run before the first boundary and are in no frame [design: bevy_app 0.20.1
//! `main_schedule.rs:290-304`]; the first frame measured took 2.5 s in the stress runs of
//! 2026-10-18, by `Time<Real>`'s delta then) is left out of the samples' and the run's
//! frame times and logged once on its own: `stress start-up: <n> frames, <ms> ms, slowest
//! <w> ms`. After it, a frame slower than [`HITCH_MS`] logs `stress hitch: <ms> ms at t <s>
//! s, <k> cells loaded in it (<ms> ms), <a> actors drawn in it (<ms> ms), at <place>`, so a
//! stall can be told from a cell load or from actors coming into view (`readahead::clocked`;
//! actors a cell draws count in both). A frame behind a loading screen
//! (`Loading::unseen_frames`) is not seen: it is left out of the frame times and its stall
//! logged apart, `stress hitch (behind a loading screen): …`, with the count of such frames
//! (and of the frames that crossed a phase change) at the exit's `stress frames:` line
//! [observed 2026-10-27: every `world::stream` stall after a door or teleport on a soak run
//! was behind the screen, and counted as hitches]. The process's memory is the runner's to
//! read (it has the process).
