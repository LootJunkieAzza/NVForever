//! Detection in the running game (docs/design/detection.md): every living, drawn actor
//! (the loaded area) measures how well it perceives the player and the other actors within
//! its reach, a few times a second, with `fnv_game::detection`'s formula; so does the
//! player, from the camera. This module measures
//! what the formula needs from the world: distance, line of sight and field of view,
//! the light at the target, who is moving, running or sneaking, and the player's shots.
//!
//! The values go to the game (`Game::detection`), where GetDetected and
//! GetDetectionLevel read them; changes of band (hidden, noticed, detected) are logged,
//! and so is the player's highest band, the original's sneak meter (HIDDEN, CAUTION,
//! DANGER). Nothing acts on them yet: combat AI is the next step.
//!
//! What is measured here and how sure it is:
//! - **Who**: every two actors of the loaded area within detection reach of each other,
//!   near the player or not (`fnv_game::sight::pairs_within`) [observed: a Frenzied Chet
//!   6,682 units from the player fought Ringo within 1 s, capture detection-1 det2,
//!   2026-10-17]; the player measures every drawn actor, out of reach too (hidden there,
//!   but GetLineOfSight can read 1: 1 at 6,682 units, same capture). Actors out of the
//!   loaded area (the low process) do not detect anyone [observed: with the player in the
//!   gas station, a Frenzied Chet outdoors never fought Ringo in 155 s, same capture
//!   det3].
//! - **Line of sight**: a ray through the collision world from the detector's eyes to the
//!   target's chest, and when that is blocked a second to its eyes (a head over a low
//!   wall is seen); the world's solid shapes block them, actors do not [engineering
//!   choice; the second ray: hypothesis, fitted to capture detection-2 det4, where Ringo
//!   behind the gas station's checkout counter read GetLineOfSight 1 both ways while our
//!   ray to the chest from the player's eyes hit the counter]. Collision exists only around the player (3 × 3 cells): where either end is
//!   out of it, only the landscape blocks sight (`fnv_game::sight::over_land`, the
//!   heights read from the cells' LAND records) [engineering choice].
//!   One ray answers both ways where two actors ask the same two points (eyes to eyes),
//!   and a pair that stood still (within [`STILL`]) since the last measurement keeps
//!   that measurement's answer once (`sights`, [`KeptSight`]) [design].
//! - **Field of view**: 95° either side of where the body faces, for every actor and for
//!   the player's detection [documented: GECK wiki GetLineOfSight; observed for the
//!   player: player.GetDetected Ringo 1 to 90° off the facing on both sides and 0 from
//!   100°, capture detection-2 det4, 2026-10-17, third person]. The player's
//!   GetLineOfSight is the camera's instead: the same ±95° and wall check from where the
//!   camera is, along where it looks (`Situation::camera_sight`) [documented: same page,
//!   "the *camera*"; observed: same capture, 0 at 90° left but 1 to 110° right, the
//!   third-person camera being off to one side].
//! - **The player as a detector**: measured like an actor, its Perception against the
//!   target's Sneak [observed: player.GetDetected Ringo and Chet 1 in the original,
//!   function probes fp1/fp2 2026-10-17, also with `tdetect` on, so the toggle and
//!   `NVF_PLAY_TEST_UNSEEN` leave it measuring; 0 for Ringo out of view and at 6,682
//!   units, capture detection-1; hypothesis: the same formula]. It feeds
//!   GetDetected / GetLineOfSight only: no detection state.
//! - **Light at the target** (0–100) [hypothesis, no source gives the game's measure]:
//!   100 × the luminance of the ambient light, plus the sunlight's times daylight outdoors
//!   or the cell's directional light indoors, plus each point light that reaches the
//!   target with the game's falloff 1 − (d/r)²; capped at 100. Outdoors the sunlight
//!   counts only when a ray from the target's chest towards the sun meets nothing within
//!   [`SUN_REACH`] (where the target is in the loaded collision; elsewhere it counts)
//!   [hypothesis, docs/design/detection.md §8]. The player's flashlight (flashlight.rs) is not counted [design: it is not
//!   the game's; whether it should show the player is undecided].
//! - **Moving and running**: from how far an actor went since the last measurement
//!   [engineering choice]; the player runs when moving at the run gait (not holding Walk)
//!   [hypothesis: a sneaking run counts as running]. Other actors sneak while
//!   `Game::sneaks` says so (SetForceSneak, a package's Always Sneak; `sneaking.rs`).
//! - **Turning** (IsTurning): the heading changed by more than [`TURN_RATE`] per second
//!   since the last measurement, left or right [hypothesis: the game's threshold is not
//!   documented].
//! - **AI off** (SetActorsAI 0): the actor does not detect anyone [documented: GECK wiki
//!   SetActorsAI, "will not process … detection"]; it can still be detected.
//! - **Action sound**: an actor's (or the player's) loudest shot since the last
//!   measurement, at the
//!   weapon's sound level (WEAP VNAM: iSoundLevelLoud, Normal, Silent) [documented:
//!   GECK wiki Category:Detection].
//! - **Detector state**: asleep when lying on a bed; alert in a combat state, busy when
//!   in Combat with someone other than the target (`fnv_game::awareness`).
//!
//! **Detection states** (docs/design/alert.md): each measurement goes to
//! `Game::observe_threat`, which keeps those of actors the detector would attack; the
//! impacts of shots and CreateDetectionEvent are detection events, owned by the shooter,
//! measured like a target that makes the event's sound and cannot be seen
//! (`Game::hear_event`); an actor that is hit is alarmed about whoever hit it
//! (`Game::hurt_by`); then `Game::settle_awareness` changes states. Changes and
//! Detection topic lines are logged here (`alert:` lines); how alerted actors look is
//! `alert.rs`.
//!
//! **The events' sound levels** (docs/design/detection.md §8) [hypothesis; the original's
//! are not documented]: an impact sounds at its IPCT's sound level, else the firing
//! weapon's; a projectile in flight raises an event where it is each measurement at its
//! PROJ's sound level (Beam for a beam, else Bullet), owned by the shooter; an explosion
//! raises an Explosion event at its EXPL's level, owned by whoever set it off (none
//! without a cause).
