//! Race and sex changes on screen (`fnv_game::appearance`, docs/spec-notes/
//! appearance-changes.md): an actor that AgeRace or SexChange changed is drawn again with
//! its new race and sex.
//!
//! - The changes are kept for the resolver (`ActorWorld::changes`): every body drawn from
//!   then on has them, an actor drawn later (its cell loaded) included. The table is
//!   rebuilt from the game every [`RESYNC_FRAMES`] frames, so a loaded game's changes
//!   reach it too.
//! - **An NPC on screen** is drawn anew at once: a resident (`residents.rs`) by the
//!   residents where its walker stands, else spawned again where its cell drew it
//!   (`resurrect::respawn`). One not drawn needs nothing.
//! - **The player**: its body is rebuilt when the change differs from the one it was built
//!   with (`player_body.rs`); with SexChange's reset the character creator's look becomes
//!   the race's first starting face for the new sex (`nvf_play::creator::preset_look`)
//!   and is kept as the player's look (`fnv_game::chargen::apply_look`).
//!
//! One log line per change (`appearance: …`; the smoke tests `agerace-sexchange-npc` and
//! `sexchange-player-reset` read them).
