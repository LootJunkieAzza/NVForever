//! Loading a save, or going back to the main menu, while playing, without the window
//! closing and another opening (docs/design/save-load.md, "Loading while playing").
//! NVForever still starts again, so a save always lands in a world built fresh from the
//! plugins and nothing of the run before carries over; the change of program is hidden
//! behind a loading screen [design, owner 2026-10-16]. The two runs overlap only for the
//! new run's first moments, not for its whole load [owner 2026-11-01, #1357: the old run
//! held its whole game, about 3.7 GB, while the new one loaded]:
//!
//! 1. This run brings a loading screen up (`nvf_play::loading::CoverRequest`, its picture
//!    one for the save's place), which holds the game. Once it is drawn, the new run
//!    starts with `--handoff <file>` and this window's place and size (`--window-at`,
//!    `--size`, `--window-maximized`); this run then updates a few times a second only.
//! 2. The new run opens its window hidden at that place ([`Hidden`]). A save it cannot
//!    load (made with plugins that cannot be loaded now, damaged, of another format) opens
//!    the main menu instead, and once the window is up a message box says why
//!    ([`LoadFailed`]; owner 2026-11-01), as for `--load` given by hand. As soon as its own
//!    loading screen (or the main menu) is up and drawn for [`SETTLE_SECS`], it shows its
//!    window over the old one, takes the focus and writes the file; it loads behind its
//!    screen from then on, alone. (Holding its script data build until then took the
//!    swap's peak from 7.6 to 6.1 GB but the load from 6-12 s to 16 s: not done.)
//! 3. This run sees the file and ends: the frame's exit logs are written (`Last`), then
//!    the process ends at once ([`EndNow`]) instead of taking its world apart piece by
//!    piece, which held its memory for about 2 s more.
//!
//! If the new run ends before it is shown (it stops at the start: a damaged archive, say),
//! the screen comes down and this game goes on; when the new run's log says why it
//! stopped, the player is told in a message box (not in unattended runs) and the log line
//! carries it. A new run that fails later, behind its own screen, is on its own: its crash
//! report is the player's. Closing this window while it waits ends the new run too. A new
//! run still hidden after [`SHOW_AFTER_SECS`] shows itself anyway.
//!
//! The new run gets this run's arguments but none of its test aids (`NVF_PLAY_TEST_*`:
//! a console line that loads would load again in every new run), except test aid
//! `NVF_PLAY_TEST_HANDOFF_EXIT=1`: the new run ends once it has taken over and its world
//! is in (the save put back) or its main menu is open, so a smoke run does not leave it
//! running; and the aids that
//! only measure (`nvf_play::MEASURING_AIDS`), so a session played by hand logs its hitches
//! after a load.
//!
//! Log: `load: handing over to a new run with --load <path>` (`with --menu`), `load:
//! <why>; opening the main menu` (the new run's, a save it could not load), `handoff: window shown after <s>
//! s` (`, before its screen was up` past the time limit), `load: the new run is up after
//! <s> s; ending this one`, `load: the new run ended (<status>) before it was ready[:
//! <why>]; staying`.
