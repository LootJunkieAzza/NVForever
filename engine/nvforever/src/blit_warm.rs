//! The upscaling pass's pipelines compiled at start-up, so a camera that switches on later
//! does not stall the frame.
//!
//! Bevy's upscaling pass (`bevy_core_pipeline` 0.19.1 `upscaling/mod.rs`,
//! `prepare_view_upscaling_pipelines`) blocks the frame until a view's blit pipeline is
//! compiled, the first time a view with a new key (output format, blend, source space)
//! is drawn ("ensure the pipeline is loaded before continuing the frame") [documented].
//! The compile is a task on the async compute pool, queued behind every other pipeline
//! being compiled, so when the camera switches on as the player comes into a new place,
//! with the place's own shaders compiling, the frame waits for all of them: 1.3 s on the
//! way into Primm, where the water reflection camera (reflection.rs) switches on, a
//! `profile hitch` line with `upscaling::prepare_view_upscaling_pipelines` 1305 ms in it
//! [observed: tools/stress tour Goodsprings–Primm, 2026-10-27; docs/design/
//! streaming-hitches.md §3 had the frame as "not looked into yet"].
//!
//! Every key the game's cameras can ask for is specialized once on the render app's first
//! frames ([`KEYS`]), without waiting: the compiles finish under the loading screen and
//! a later camera finds its pipeline ready. The formats are those of the window (Bevy
//! names a window's Bgra8UnormSrgb Rgba8UnormSrgb) and of the image targets
//! (Bgra8UnormSrgb for the Pip-Boy, terminal, scope and table views, Rgba16Float for the
//! reflection, R32Float for the ripples); a camera after the first on a target blends
//! (alpha blending); no camera sets a compositing space [engineering choice: a dozen small
//! full-screen pipelines].
