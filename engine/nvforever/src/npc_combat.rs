//! Combat AI, step CA1 (docs/design/combat-ai.md): actors in Combat
//! (`fnv_game::awareness`) attack their target with the same rules as the player
//! (`nvf_play::combat`).
//!
//! Each drawn, living actor in Combat with a target:
//! - **What it fights with**: the weapon drawn on it (`HeldWeapon`); a gun (a weapon
//!   that fires a projectile) is a ranged attack, any other weapon a melee one; without
//!   a weapon a creature attacks with its own damage and reach (CREA DATA Damage, RNAM
//!   Attack Reach), an NPC with its fists [design].
//! - **How near it has to be** ([`engage`]), told to the AI that moves actors
//!   (`Awarenesses::engage`, `fnv_ai::alert` closes in): a gun's useful range, a melee
//!   weapon's or creature's reach [design].
//! - **A gun's reach** ([`gun_reach`], docs/design/combat-ai.md §16): its max range
//!   (WEAP DNAM) times its style's Ranged Weapon Max Range Mult, never beyond its
//!   projectile's range (PROJ: a flamer's flame goes 640 units). It does not fire at a
//!   target beyond that ("Actors outside this range will not fire their weapon until
//!   they are within distance of this value to the target" [documented: GECK wiki
//!   Weapons]), nor with an explosive projectile at one within the explosion's radius
//!   [design]; it leaves cover to close in on a target out of reach [design], and stops
//!   short of it at a distance by its weapon's reach (a shotgun or flamer close, a
//!   sniper rifle far, a launcher clear of its own blast).
//! - **When it fires**: only while it detects and sees its target (the latest
//!   detection of the pair: above 0, in sight), after a reaction time from the moment it
//!   first saw it in this fight, with its weapon drawn, and a gun only facing it (within
//!   [`FIRE_FACING`] of straight ahead; owner's playtest list 5 item 33). A gun keeps its own cycle
//!   (`fnv_combat::attack::Cycle`: fire rate, magazine, reload) as the player's does;
//!   the trigger is held for automatic weapons and pulled once a shot for the others
//!   [design]. As the trigger is pulled, a gun fires only with a clear line from its
//!   eyes and muzzle to the target's chest, else its head (`combat_tactics`: a wall in
//!   the way), whatever detection says; held, it steps aside or closes in [design].
//!   Test aid `NVF_PLAY_TEST_SEE_THROUGH_WALLS=1`: fighters count their targets as seen
//!   whatever detection says, standing in for detection that says "seen" while a wall
//!   stops the shot (smoke `combat-wall-hold`).
//! - **Reloading**: its gun's magazine (WEAP Clip Size) empties as it fires, and it
//!   reloads as soon as it is empty, whether it can fire then or not, playing its
//!   weapon's reload clips (`attack_anims`, [`Move::Reload`]) for as long as they run in
//!   its rig ([`AttackTimes::reloads`]; the tuning's fallback time until they are
//!   known). A weapon that loads round by round (the .357 revolver, lever-actions;
//!   docs/spec-notes/combat-rules.md §4) loads every round: it pulls no trigger while it
//!   reloads, which would close the weapon after one. The same gun keeps its magazine
//!   on a new target. Rounds come from nowhere: an NPC uses no ammunition from its
//!   inventory [design: owner 2026-10-17, "they dont use ammo"]. Reloading before the
//!   magazine is empty (in cover, out of sight) is not built.
//! - **Where it aims**: from its eyes at the target's chest, the shot drawn from its
//!   weapon's muzzle (the model's `ProjectileNode`, `weapons::Muzzle`) closing onto that
//!   line, as the player's first-person shots (`ActorFire`; owner 2026-10-11: "the shots
//!   were coming from Violet's face, not the gun"). A creature's embedded weapon (a
//!   sentry bot's minigun, an eyebot's laser) shoots from the node of the creature's
//!   skeleton its WEAP `NNAM` names ("Node that the weapon is attached to" [documented:
//!   GECK wiki Weapons, Embedded Weapon]; `ProjectileNode_RGatling`,
//!   `ProjectileNode_HeadLaser`); a node only in a body part's model is not found
//!   [design: the skeleton's nodes are the ones spawned]. Without either, from the eyes. A
//!   creature with no weapon drawn in its hands fights with such an embedded gun when its
//!   skeleton has the gun's node (before 2026-10-24 embedded guns were never fired: the
//!   sentry bot only struck) [design: which of several; the first equipped or carried].
//!   Inside its spread: the documented actor
//!   spread for its weapon skill, standing, plus an aim that settles over
//!   [`SETTLE_SECONDS`] of firing at the same target [design].
//! - **Aiming down the sights** (owner's playtest list 2026-10-11: "only if the target
//!   is at a distance; anything less than 20 metres they fire from the hip"): a gun
//!   with sights (WEAP Sight FOV above 0; 0 "essentially disables iron sights"
//!   [documented: GECK wiki Weapons]) is aimed down its sights while the actor fires at
//!   a target more than [`HIP_FIRE_WITHIN`] away (20 m at 70 units per metre,
//!   docs/spec-notes/physics.md §6.3), from the hip nearer ([`aims_down_sights`]).
//!   Aimed, the spread loses the unaimed penalty (fUnaimedSpreadPenalty) [documented:
//!   GECK wiki Gun Spread Formula (New Vegas)], the actor plays its weapon's iron-sights
//!   aim and attack clips (`2hraimis.kf`, `2hrattack3is.kf`, `attack_anims.rs`), and it
//!   walks instead of running (`Awarenesses::aiming`, `fnv_ai::alert`). The record's
//!   Sight Usage ("the percentage of fCombatIronSightsDistance" beyond which an actor
//!   uses its sights [documented: GECK wiki Weapons]) is not used: the owner's 20 m
//!   rule stands in for it, and fCombatIronSightsDistance is neither in FalloutNV.esm
//!   nor on the wiki.
//! - **How it looks** (`attack_anims.rs`): each shot and blow asks for its attack clip
//!   ([`PlayAttack`]); a blow's damage is dealt at its clip's `Hit` key
//!   ([`AttackTimes`]), and lands if the target is still within reach then [design].
//!   Each fighter's pitch to its target ([`Fighters::pitch`]) bends its aim.
//! - **Melee**: it closes in until its body is [`MELEE_STOP_GAP`] from its target's
//!   (the bodies as `nvf_play::blocking` has them: a long creature reaches out in front
//!   of its feet) and its reach keeps it off ([`melee_spacing`]), and strikes while the
//!   gap is within [`MELEE_HIT_GAP`] or the target within its reach and it sees the
//!   target, a blow every [`STRIKE_SECONDS`] (divided by the weapon's attack speed)
//!   [design; owner 2026-10-11: a dog gets into range and bites, it does not push the
//!   player around]. Without bodies to measure, its reach from its feet counts. A
//!   creature keeps its own reach and body from its target's centre instead
//!   ([`creature_spacing`], [`CREATURE_BODY_REACH`]).
//! - **Creatures' power attacks** (a radscorpion's sting): a creature's blow is a power
//!   attack by its combat style's Power Attack % Chance [documented: GECK wiki Combat
//!   Style], or [`FALLBACK_POWER_CHANCE`] where the style gives none [design: owner
//!   2026-10-16, random power attacks where the rule is not found]; which one by the
//!   style's normal and forward shares, evenly where both are 0 [design], among those it
//!   has clips for ([`AttackTimes::powers`]). It lands at its own clip's `Hit` key, deals
//!   the creature's usual damage [design: no power damage rule is sourced] and carries
//!   its attack group to the hit, for an unarmed attack effect that names it
//!   (`nvf_play::combat::hit_effects::applies`). Rolled on their own sequence.
//! - **People's power attacks** (docs/spec-notes/combat-rules.md §10.1): a person's
//!   blow with a melee weapon or its fists is a power attack by its style's Power Attack
//!   % Chance plus the recoil/stagger and unconscious bonuses [documented: GECK wiki
//!   Combat Style]; which one by the style's five shares ("Choose Attack using % Chance")
//!   or by how it moves against its facing ([`local_motion`], [`POWER_MOVE_SPEED`]),
//!   standing with both legs crippled, among the clips its rig has for its weapon
//!   (`AttackTimes::people_powers`): a direction without one is an ordinary blow
//!   ([`pick_people_power`]). It lands at its clip's `Hit` key, its next decision waits
//!   for the clip's end, the blow carries its attack group (the direction's damage bonus
//!   in `nvf_play::combat`, breaking blocks) and the actor tries its PowerAttack line.
//!   Rolled on their own sequence.
//! - **Melee combos** (docs/design/combat-ai.md §15): a blow's clip with an `a:` text
//!   key (`a:L` on the `AttackRight` clips, `a:R` on the `AttackLeft` ones; `fnv_combat::
//!   melee`) brings the next melee decision forward to that key; a blow decided between
//!   the key and the clip's end goes on the combo with the group the key names (right,
//!   left, right…, fists alternating hands), as the player's swings do, cutting the clip
//!   short. A blow decided later, after a hold, a block or a recoil starts again from the
//!   weapon's own attack group. A clip without an `a:` key keeps the [`STRIKE_SECONDS`]
//!   pace [design; owner request 2026-10-16].
//!
//! - **Its combat style** (CSTY, `fnv_game::combat_style`; docs/design/combat-ai.md
//!   §10.4) [documented: GECK wiki Combat Style]: Weapon Restrictions "Melee Only" has
//!   it fight a gun-holder with its fists; the Ranged Weapon Max Range Mult scales the
//!   weapon's max range in the distance it fights from; a semi-automatic gun waits a
//!   random time between the weapon's Semi-Auto Fire Delay Min and Max, times the
//!   style's multipliers, between shots ("semi-auto weapon's fire rate when used by
//!   actors" [documented: GECK wiki Weapons]); in melee each time it may strike it makes
//!   the melee decision (attack chance with the hand-to-hand bonus and the attack skill
//!   modifier, under attack or not), and holds for the Hold Timer when it does not attack.
//! - **Confidence and fleeing** (`fnv_game::combat_group`, docs/design/combat-ai.md
//!   §12.2): each fighter's strength (health, damage per second) goes to the game every
//!   frame; once hurt, every random 0 to fCombatThreatRatioUpdateTime seconds it makes a
//!   flee check (its group's threat ratio, and its personal one when its style says so,
//!   against its confidence and this fight's modifier) and flees when it fails
//!   (`fnv_ai::alert` runs it to a door, cover or away). It does not attack while it
//!   flees. At its flee spot, hurt or with a target it sees within
//!   fCombatFleeBoostConfidenceTargetRadius, its confidence goes up a level and it checks
//!   again: it fights again or flees on; after fCombatFleeWaitTime there it checks again
//!   without a boost [hypothesis: what the wait time is for].
//! - **Hiding at the flee spot** (docs/design/combat-ai.md §12.2.1): a person that has
//!   reached its flee spot is crouched there by the rules (`Game::sneaks`,
//!   `Game::at_flee_spot`: the crouched set, and the original's cower idle over it,
//!   `idles.rs`) while it waits.
//!   Seen by its enemy there for [`HIDE_SEEN_SECONDS`], it runs on to another spot, at
//!   most [`HIDE_MOVES`] times a flight [design: owner 2026-10-17, "fleeing enemies run
//!   and hide, crouching down when they stop, to hide from their enemies"].
//! - **Tactics** (`combat_tactics`): cover by the style's Take Cover Chance and timers,
//!   flank places for a group's gunmen, no shot while a friend stands in the line of
//!   fire, and a step back from a target nearer than [`tactics::BACK_OFF_WITHIN`]
//!   [design].
//! - **Moving while it fights**: it stays facing its target and strafes or backs away
//!   (nvforever `residents`, `Core::aims`), so it fires on the move.
//!
//! - **Attack lines**: each shot or blow it begins tries its Attack line, said at most
//!   once per its attack timer (`fnv_game::combat_lines`, docs/spec-notes/combat-dialogue.md).
//! - **Crouching, blocking, closing in** (people only; docs/design/combat-ai.md §14, the
//!   rules in `combat_stance`): a gunman that sees a far target now and then crouches to
//!   fire (`Awarenesses::crouching`), hides crouched behind low cover, shifts sideways
//!   after a while and stands up for a close-combat enemy coming in or to move; a melee
//!   fighter against a close-combat opponent makes the melee decision block first, also
//!   in reaction to the opponent's blow, and the attacker of a blocked blow recoils;
//!   against a gunman that sees it from afar it bounds from cover to cover, or charges
//!   when there is none, or stays by a gunman of its group until the target comes near.
//!
//! - **The combat style's other fields** (docs/design/combat-ai.md §17): a melee
//!   fighter's hold also makes the maneuver decision, a dodge left, right, back or forward
//!   or an idle (`combat_style::maneuver`); a rushing attack rolled as it closes in makes
//!   its first decision an attack; no pursuit beyond its Combat Radius from where its
//!   fight began or it was last hit; no new target outside its Max Targeting FOV; an
//!   explosive shot held while it would catch itself, a comrade or a bystander (the
//!   Ignore Damaging flags); a run out of a live grenade's blast unless Ignore Threats.
//!
//! Whom it fights is the detection states' (its combat target). Not built: throwing
//! grenades, ammunition use (module notes: reloading), weapon choice among several.
