//! Actors made ready before they come into range (docs/design/streaming-hitches.md §2).
//!
//! When the exterior cell the loaded grid is around changes, the actors of the band just
//! outside it (the ring between the loaded `(2r+1)²` cells and `(2r+3)²`: placed NPCs and
//! creatures there, and residents whose walkers stand there) are listed, their appearance
//! resolved and their parts, skeleton and weapon model read and parsed on a worker thread
//! (`ActorCtx::parts_ready`). What has been read is then prepared on this thread (meshes,
//! materials, textures) within [`PREPARE_BUDGET`] a frame, the NPCs' FaceGen `.egm` and
//! `.egt` files read on a worker thread, and once a skeleton is prepared the clip sets and weapon stance its actor needs
//! are loaded from their KF files on a worker thread (`actors::Anims::warm`). So an actor
//! walking into the loaded cells, or a cell of them loading, finds what it is drawn from
//! ready and is drawn at once without reading or preparing it in that frame [engineering
//! choice].
//!
//! An actor is drawn only once its parts are prepared (behind a loading screen: read, so
//! they can be prepared without reading a file) and its current stance and FaceGen files
//! have been read (missing files count as ready) ([`ready_to_draw`], used by
//! `nav::show_actor` and `world::load_cell` after the start); one that was not read ahead
//! waits a few frames for the worker and the queue (#1429).
//!
//! The clock: time spent drawing actors ([`clocked`]), which the stress hitch lines
//! report (`stress_sample.rs`), so a slow frame can be told from one that spawned actors.
//! At the exit `actor read-ahead summary: …` (smoke tests read it). Test aid
//! `NVF_PLAY_TEST_NO_READ_AHEAD=1` turns the read-ahead off (to measure what it saves).
