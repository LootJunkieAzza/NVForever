//! The actor's side of a conversation's facing (dialogue step D7,
//! docs/design/dialogue-play.md §8): while the dialogue screen is open, the actor the
//! player talks to turns its head to the player's eyes and, standing, its body too. The
//! player's side (the view turning to the actor's face) is
//! `nvf_play::dialogue_look`, which this file tells where the face is
//! ([`SpeakerFace`]).
//!
//! Only conversations (`Game::dialogue`). A line an actor says to someone outside one
//! (SayTo, a hello, a conversation between actors) is `speech_look.rs`'s
//! (dialogue-play.md §9).
//!
//! - **Head.** The head bone is turned on top of the frame's animation (after
//!   `locomotion::drive` has posed the skeleton), towards the player's eye, eased in over
//!   [`HEAD_IN_SECONDS`] and out over [`HEAD_OUT_SECONDS`] when the conversation ends.
//!   Which bone and how far come from the game's data where it has them: the body part
//!   with the "IK Data - Headtracking" flag in the actor's body part data names the bone
//!   (its IK start node, `Bip01 Head`) and the largest angle (its Tracking Max Angle, 60
//!   for `DefaultBodyPartData`) [documented: GECK wiki "Body Part", owner export;
//!   observed: FalloutNV.esm BPTD 0x1D]. That angle limits the turn to either side
//!   [hypothesis: degrees, and that it bounds the yaw]; up and down the head goes at most
//!   [`HEAD_PITCH_LIMIT`] [design]. The neck bones above the head are turned by up to
//!   [`NECK_SHARE`] of the turn ([`shares`]), so the neck does not twist at one joint
//!   [design; whether the original turns anything but the IK start node is not known].
//!   Everything that hangs from the head bone or is skinned to it follows: the face and
//!   its lip sync (`lips.rs` moves vertices, not bones), hair, eyes, hats.
//! - **Body.** An actor standing in its idle whose body faces more than
//!   [`BODY_TURN_FROM`] away from the player turns on the spot to face them, eased, at
//!   about [`BODY_TURN_SPEED`], asking for the skeleton's turn clips through
//!   `Locomotion::turn` [design; the original can turn the whole body to a head-track
//!   target: documented for the `Look` function, GECK wiki "Look", owner export]. The
//!   body keeps its new heading afterwards [design: AI packages will take over].
//! - **Head only** for an actor whose body something else places or holds: an actor the
//!   AI runs (`--play`, `--npc-packages`: `fnv_ai::Ai::update_held` turns its body on the
//!   spot and keeps it facing the player for the whole conversation, in the walker's
//!   heading, which the engine draws; turning the drawn body here would be undone by the
//!   next frame's drawing), a `--npc-travel` traveller (its heading is the walker's), an
//!   actor under the walk test,
//!   and one marked [`BodyHeld`] (in furniture or lying down: `furniture.rs` marks the
//!   actors it seats).
//! - **Nobody turns** when the actor is dead or a ragdoll (never touched), is not a
//!   human-style NPC (a creature, a robot, a talking activator), has no such bone, or its
//!   body part data does not allow head tracking. The view still turns to it.
//! - **Pausing** (docs/design/dialogue.md §8). The eases run on the virtual clock: the
//!   Esc pause menu holds them. With `--menu-pause original` the picture stands still
//!   during the conversation, so the turns are completed at once and the frozen picture
//!   shows the two facing each other; the head eases back when the clock runs again.
//!
//! The angles and timings are NVForever's design choices unless tagged otherwise.
//!
//! Log, one line each, starting `dialogue look:`: an actor starts facing the player
//! (head and body, head only and why, or nobody and why; the angles), and stops.
//!
//! Test aid `NVF_PLAY_TEST_TALK_HEAD_ONLY=1`: no body turns (as if every actor were
//! [`BodyHeld`]), to see the head at its limit. Not a game behaviour.
