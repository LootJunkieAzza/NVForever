//! Furniture in use (docs/spec-notes/furniture.md): actors and the player get onto
//! chairs, stools, benches and beds, stay there, and get off again.
//!
//! `fnv_actor::furniture` decides everything that does not need the engine: the entry
//! point (a marker of the furniture's model that the base's marker flags enable), the
//! clips (the ones the game's IDLE tree names for the marker, the actor's sex and the
//! phase), and where the actor's root stands in each phase (`UseFrames`). Here the clips
//! are played and the roots moved:
//!
//! - An actor with a [`SitOn`] walks the last steps to the entry point, plays the
//!   getting-on clip, then the loop on the furniture; [`GetUp`] makes it play the
//!   getting-off clip, after which it is back at the entry point with its back to the
//!   furniture and both components are gone. `--npc-sit ACTOR=FURNITURE[:SECONDS]`
//!   sends a travelling NPC (`nav.rs`) to a piece of furniture and sits it down.
//! - The player uses furniture by activating it (`nvf_play::furniture`) and gets up by
//!   pressing a movement control or activating it again. Its third-person body plays the
//!   clips ([`BodyOverride`], read by `player_body.rs`); in first person the view is that
//!   body's eye and the body is not drawn [design]. Beds are used the same way: the
//!   player lies down as a sleeping actor does [owner request 2026-10-10]. No game time
//!   passes and there is no sleep menu (not built).
//!
//! While a clip plays, `GetSitting` / `GetSleeping` and the other furniture functions of
//! the script runtime answer for the user (`nvf_play::furniture::set_use`).
//!
//! Getting off plays in a frame placed so that the getting-off clip's first `Bip01`
//! position is where the getting-on clip left the body: the plain exits start where their
//! enter clips stop (furniture.md §4), so for them nothing changes; Doc Mitchell's
//! `SpecialIdle_NVDocChairFrontExit` (sequence `SpecialIdle_DocSitLeftExit`) starts its
//! `Bip01` at (−52.2, 0.1) instead of the seat's (0, 54.3) [observed: the KF], and the
//! body jumped 75 units to the side before walking off (owner's playtest list 5 item 40)
//! [hypothesis: the game plays every exit from where the body sits].
//!
//! Fidgets while on furniture (state 3 of the IDLE tree) are `idles.rs`'s: they play over
//! the loop and fade out when getting off starts (furniture.md §8).
//!
//! Not done: work spots without getting-on clips (marker 22), checking the entry point
//! against the navmesh, and sandboxing actors choosing furniture themselves (residents
//! use the furniture their package names, a bed for Sleep and a seat for Eat packages:
//! `residents.rs`).
