//! How fast creatures move, and the stance they move in (docs/spec-notes/actors.md §8.10;
//! the owner's playtest 2026-10-16: cazadors moved far too slowly and their walk stopped
//! and started).
//!
//! - **Speed**: a creature walks at the root motion of its `Forward` clip and runs at
//!   that of its `FastForward` clip, times its scale, its Speed Mult (CREA ACBS) and
//!   its skeleton's share ([`skeleton_share`]: 1 but for cazadors). The AI
//!   moves it at those speeds (`fnv_ai::Ai::speeds`).
//!   People walk and run at `fnv_ai::NPC_WALK` and `NPC_RUN` times their Speed Mult and
//!   their body armour's share ([`person_pace`]), the armour looked at again every
//!   second. The Speed Mult is the current one ([`current_speed_mult`]: SetAV, ModAV,
//!   effects and damage count), read again every quarter second for people and
//!   creatures alike, and the speeds are worked out afresh from the unscaled ones when it
//!   changes (issue #2118; [`refresh_speeds`]). Before this every actor
//!   walked at 86.8 and ran at 344 units/s: a cazador's walk clip (217 units/s) played
//!   at its slowest rate (0.4), and 344 is the point between its walk and run clips
//!   (the geometric mean of 217 and 546), so a small slow-down swapped the two clips back
//!   and forth: the stop-and-start.
//! - **Clip rate**: the clips play `Speed Mult × the share` faster
//!   (`Locomotion::pace`), as the movement comes from them, and the move is chosen for the
//!   velocity divided by that: a medium cazador walking at 379 units/s plays its walk clip
//!   at 1.75, not its run clip at 0.7.
//! - **Turning**: a creature turns at its CREA `TNAM` × [`TNAM_TURN_MULT`] degrees a
//!   second, walking and standing, whatever its scale ([`creature_turn_rate`];
//!   [`CREATURE_TURN_RATE`] × its scale when TNAM is 0), and turns on the spot only when
//!   its way is more than 60 degrees off; the people's 120 degrees a second and 20
//!   degrees made a fast cazador stop at the start of every short walk.
//! - **Stance**: a creature whose folder has `h2h` movement clips (the cazador, the dog,
//!   the mirelurk king) moves on them while it is not in the Normal detection state
//!   (Alert, Combat, Lost: `locomotion::Locomotion::set_alert`), on its `mt` clips
//!   otherwise; the cazador scurries along the ground while calm and flies when alert
//!   [observed: the owner, 2026-10-16]. Its speeds follow the stance's clips. The
//!   sonic-bark cyberdog, in the dog's folder, keeps its `mt` clips ([`has_alert_stance`]).
//!
//! Speeds are given once the creature is drawn (its clips are then loaded), so one walking
//! off-screen before that moves at the people's speeds; an actor no longer drawn keeps
//! the speeds it was last given until it is drawn again.
