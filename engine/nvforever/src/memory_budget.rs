//! The machine's memory budgets and the asset caches' keep limits that follow them (#1170).
//!
//! At the start the game reads the machine's RAM (`GlobalMemoryStatusEx`) and the GPU's
//! memory budget, and logs both (`memory budget: RAM … MB, GPU budget … MB (…)`, or that the
//! GPU budget could not be read). The GPU budget is `VK_EXT_memory_budget`'s, read through
//! wgpu's Vulkan device (`Device::as_hal`): wgpu-hal 30 enables that extension whenever the
//! adapter offers it (except on Mesa's RADV) [documented: wgpu-hal 30.0.1
//! `vulkan/adapter.rs`, "Optional `VK_EXT_memory_budget`"], so no wgpu patch is needed. Of
//! the device-local heaps ([`device_local`]) it sums `heapBudget`, "an estimate of how much
//! memory the process can allocate from that heap before allocations may fail or cause
//! performance degradation", and `heapUsage`, "the estimated heap usage of the process"
//! [documented: Vulkan `VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT`]. Budget and use are the
//! same memory, measured by the driver: what the process holds of it, blocks the allocator
//! keeps empty included (#898). An integrated GPU's memory is the machine's RAM: it has no
//! GPU budget here, and the RAM check covers it.
//!
//! **Keep limits** ([`nvf_assets::KeepLimits`], read by the release sweep each 2 s) scale
//! down from five minutes and 2048 unused entries per cache on a machine with less than
//! [`FULL_RAM_MB`] of RAM or [`FULL_VRAM_MB`] of GPU budget, by the smaller share ([`limits_for`]).
//! **Pressed** ([`pressed`], checked every 2 s, the GPU budget read again each time so other
//! programs' use counts): when the process uses over 85 % of the GPU budget, or the machine
//! has under 10 % of its RAM free, the sweep keeps [`PRESSED`] (unused entries go after
//! 10 s, at most 32 per cache, the longest unused first) until the GPU use is under 75 % and
//! over 20 % of the RAM is free. Each change is logged.
//!
//! Test aids, since there is no small machine to test on: `NVF_PLAY_TEST_VRAM_MB=<MB>` and
//! `NVF_PLAY_TEST_RAM_MB=<MB>` take the GPU budget and the RAM as at most that (the RAM's
//! free part shrinks by what was taken off).
