//! Particle effects of add-on nodes (docs/spec-notes/particles.md): the sparks and smoke
//! of a muzzle flash, a missile's trail, the flamer's flame, the dust of an impact.
//!
//! - **Add-on nodes.** A model's `BSValueNode` named `AddOnNode<n>` stands for the ADDN
//!   record with that node index, whose model (`meshes\mps\…`) holds one or more
//!   `NiParticleSystem`s under a `BSMasterParticleSystem` [documented: xEdit ADDN;
//!   nif.xml]. Each add-on node in the world is an **emitter** of those systems for as
//!   long as it exists ([`AddonEmitter`]); the particles belong to the system, live in
//!   the world and outlast the node [hypothesis: the meaning of "master particle
//!   system", from the systems' `world_space` flag and from their particle counts,
//!   which equal birth rate × longest life × the emitter controller's `max_emitters`].
//! - **A system** is read by `nvf_assets::particles`; its particles are simulated here:
//!   born at the emitter's rate in its volume, thrown within its cone about the emitter
//!   object's +z, then aged, pulled by its gravity modifiers (in the world's axes),
//!   slowed by its drag modifiers, turned, sized by grow and fade, coloured over their
//!   life. A system holds at most its data block's vertex count of particles, and
//!   serves at most `max_emitters` emitters a frame.
//! - **Drawn** as one mesh per system, a square facing the camera for each particle,
//!   with the system's own texture, blending and vertex colours.
//! - **Model emitters** ([`ModelEmitter`]): a model's own particle systems, emitted from
//!   where its emitter objects are in the file (explosions, `shot_fx`).
//! - **Modifiers switched on and off** (`NiPSysModifierActiveCtlr`): a gravity or drag
//!   modifier acts on a particle while the emitter it came from is at a time its keys
//!   say on (`nvf_assets::particles::ModifierActive`).
//! - **Mesh emitters** start particles on their meshes (vertices, face or edge centres,
//!   anywhere on the faces or edges) thrown along the mesh's normal there; **strip
//!   systems** trail a strip of recorded points behind each particle, drawn as a ribbon;
//!   the **bomb** modifier pushes particles away from its object, **planar colliders**
//!   bounce or kill them; float controllers key emitter fields, gravity strength and
//!   birth rates over the emitter's time (particles.md §6). Bombs, colliders and
//!   spherical gravity sit where the emitter's node placed them when the particle was
//!   born (`Particle::frame`).
//! - **Placed models** emit their own systems and their add-on nodes' from a holder at
//!   the reference (`world::spawn_emitters`: Gomorrah's roof fires), not while hidden;
//!   a placed model's own live particles go at once when it is hidden or gone (a taken
//!   snow globe, #1596; log `particles: <ref> is not drawn any more: its <n> live
//!   particles go`);
//!   a placed model's own systems are that reference's own, and a master system serves
//!   the add-on nodes nearest the camera first (particles.md §7). References a script
//!   enables (`nvf_play::script_draw`) emit too.
//! - **Damage stages.** An add-on node below a `BSDamageStage` node emits only while its
//!   reference is drawn at one of that node's model damage stages ([`StagedAddon`],
//!   docs/spec-notes/destruction-stages.md): a motorcycle's `DamageStage1-3` smoke starts
//!   when a hit takes it to stage 1, never on an intact or indestructible (STAT) bike.
//!   Log: `damage stage: <ref> add-on node <n> waits for model stages <lo>-<hi> (at <s>)`
//!   when one is placed, then `… on at model stage <s>` / `… off at model stage <s>`.
//! - **Sequences of drawn models** (particles.md §6.7): a placed model drawn with its own
//!   nodes (a [`crate::object_anims::GroupRig`]) whose sequences drive a system's emitter
//!   emits by the sequence playing on it, on that sequence's time, and not at all while it
//!   plays none of them; and from its emitter object's node as the sequence moves it (the
//!   REPCONN rockets' exhaust rides with the rockets). Modifiers switched on and off by
//!   the sequences follow the one a particle was born under.
//! - Not built: turbulence, spawn-on-death; a mesh emitter's meshes stay where the file
//!   puts them; gravity strength keys from the first sequence only.
