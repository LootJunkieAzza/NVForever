//! Faces in the game (dialogue step D6, docs/spec-notes/lipsync.md): while an NPC says a
//! voiced response its face moves from the response's `.lip` file in time with the
//! sound, shows the response's emotion and nods its head; between lines a face near the
//! camera blinks and its eyes move.
//!
//! - **What moves.** The `.lip` gives a weight per channel, 30 times a second
//!   (`fnv_voice::lip`). A channel's name is the label of a morph in the FaceGen `.tri`
//!   file beside a head part's model (`fnv_actor::tri`): the head, the mouth, the lower
//!   teeth, the tongue, the eyes, beards and eyebrows each carry the morphs that concern
//!   them. A vertex is drawn at: the model's vertex, shaped by the actor's FaceGen `.egm`
//!   (facegen.rs), plus Σ weight × the morph's displacement [hypothesis: the morphs add
//!   up linearly on top of the face shape; lipsync.md §4.3].
//! - **Which channels.** The sixteen mouth shapes, the blinks, the brows, the squints and
//!   the eyes' Look channels ([`DRIVEN_MODIFIERS`]) move morphs; the three head channels
//!   turn the head bone ([`head_quat`], lipsync.md §5.1; their unit is a hypothesis,
//!   [`HEAD_RADIANS_PER_UNIT`]). The response's emotion adds the head's expression morph
//!   of its name ([`EXPRESSIONS`], lipsync.md §5.2) [engine choice].
//! - **When.** `nvf_play::voice` says which response each speaker is saying and when its
//!   sound started (also with `--no-voice`); the frame for the moment `t` after that is
//!   `t × 30 − start frame`, the two frames around it mixed. The frames a file has
//!   before the sound starts are not shown [hypothesis]. When the line ends or is cut
//!   the face eases back to rest over [`EASE_SECONDS`] [engine choice].
//! - **Between lines** ([`IdleFace`], lipsync.md §5.3, a design): drawn living NPCs
//!   within [`IDLE_RADIUS`] of the camera blink, their eyes make up what head tracking's
//!   turn stops short of, and they glance a little.
//! - **How.** An actor with a moving face ([`Face`]) has each of its moving shapes drawn
//!   from a mesh of its own whose positions are rewritten when the weights change
//!   (normals are kept as they are); it gets its own meshes back when it is let go.
//!   Speakers without a rig — creatures, robots, talking activators, the unseen — are
//!   skipped, with a log line.
//!
//! One log line per response: `lip: animating <path> ...` or `lip: skipped <path>: <why>`;
//! a `lip summary:` and a `face idle summary:` at the end. `--no-lip` turns it all off,
//! `--no-face-idle` the faces between lines only.
