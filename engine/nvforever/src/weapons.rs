//! Weapons in NPCs' hands (workstream 5 part H, docs/spec-notes/actors.md §9): the weapon
//! an actor carries is drawn on its skeleton's `Weapon` node; the stance's holster, equip,
//! aim and unequip clips play over its locomotion by track priority, and the `Weapon` node
//! moves between holster bone and hand at the clips' `prn:` keys. Nothing decides when to
//! draw yet (Layer 6); `--actor-weapons drawn` and the test aid `--actor-weapon-test` do.
