//! Idle animations played (docs/spec-notes/idles.md): what the game's rules ask for
//! (`fnv_game::idles`: a script's `PlayIdle`, a package's begin, end and change idles,
//! the idles on a dialogue response) and the idle collections of packages and idle
//! markers, on the actors drawn and on the player.
//!
//! - **Requests.** Each frame the game's `idle_requests` are taken and started: the
//!   idle's `.kf` is loaded, and how often it loops is rolled from its record
//!   (`IdleDef::loops`). An actor that is not drawn plays nothing.
//! - **Collections.** An actor standing where its package has it, with nothing else to
//!   do (`Residents::standing`), plays the idles of its package's collection, or of the
//!   idle marker it stands at (which override the package's [documented]), picked by
//!   `fnv_game::idles::IdlePicker`; so does the player under a script package. The pick
//!   is asked of the game like any other idle, so it is traced. A collection idle ends
//!   when its actor walks off.
//! - **Playing.** `fnv_actor::idle_play::IdlePlay` keeps each idle's time, loops and
//!   fades. On an NPC the clip is laid over what it plays otherwise (its locomotion, or
//!   its furniture clip) by track priority, on two more blend layers ([`ActorIdle`],
//!   read by `locomotion::drive`): the idle, and the one before it while the new one
//!   fades in. On the player ([`PlayerIdles`], read by `player_body.rs`) an idle whose
//!   clip drives the first-person camera node plays on the first-person rig and turns
//!   the view; any other plays on the third-person body.
//! - **Ends.** A one-shot idle ends at the end of its clip. An idle that loops for ever
//!   is replaced by the next idle asked for, and leaves its loop when the package (or
//!   marker) that asked for it is no longer the actor's.
//! - The rules are told what each actor plays (`Game::set_idle_playing`), which is what
//!   `IsIdlePlaying` answers.
//! - The slot also plays the animation groups scripts ask of actors (`PlayGroup`,
//!   `actor_groups.rs`); those are not idles for `IsIdlePlaying`.
//!
//! - **Drawn-weapon fidgets** (idles.md §11). An NPC standing still with its weapon out
//!   (a rifle loitering, lifting it one-handed to rest the arm, shifting its weight; an
//!   automatic rifle scanning), and the player standing still in third person with a
//!   weapon out and not aiming or firing, is checked every [`FIDGET_CHECK_SECONDS`]
//!   for a fidget from the IDLE tree (`Game::fidget`); the tree's own random
//!   percentages decide whether one plays. A fidget ends when its actor moves, puts the
//!   weapon away, or (the player) aims, fires, reloads or goes to first person.
//! - **Fidgets on furniture** (furniture.md §8). An actor on a chair, a bench, a bed or
//!   other furniture (`GetSitting` or `GetSleeping` 3: not getting on or off) is
//!   checked the same way for a fidget from the tree's furniture branch (a seated man
//!   relaxing, a sleeper stirring, a dancer, a wall leaner); so is the player on
//!   furniture in third person. It plays over the furniture's loop and ends (fades
//!   out) when its actor starts getting off.
//!
//! - **Talking gestures** (idles.md §12). An NPC in a conversation (with the player
//!   in the dialogue screen, or with another actor) is given a gesture from the IDLE
//!   tree's dialogue groups (`Game::talk_gesture`) when it starts saying a response,
//!   when it stops (it listens), and whenever the gesture it plays ends while it is
//!   still in the same part; the tree chooses talking or listening, the mood, sitting
//!   or standing. A response's own idle (INFO `SNAM`/`LNAM`) or any other idle asked
//!   for comes first: no gesture is picked while one plays. A gesture ends when the
//!   conversation does, or when the actor walks.
//!
//! - **Cowering** (idles.md §13). An NPC fleeing from a fight that stands still (as
//!   when its flight begins, or at its flee spot) is checked every
//!   [`COWER_CHECK_SECONDS`] for the idle the tree plays while fleeing
//!   (`Game::flee_idle`: `CowerIdles`, `3rdP_Cowering.kf`, by its own conditions
//!   IsMoving 0 and GetCurrentAIProcedure 16), before its fidgets. Started, it is not
//!   stopped when its actor runs: its arms and head (priority 33) are laid over the
//!   unarmed run (30), whose legs win over its own (23), so it runs with its hands over
//!   its head; standing, over the crouched set (20) the rules give a person at its flee
//!   spot, the whole cower shows [observed: the clips' priorities; owner 2026-10-17,
//!   "they'll cower whilst running but they only crouch when stopped"]. It ends when its
//!   actor no longer flees; after its loops (2 to 12 of 12 s) it is picked again when
//!   the actor next stands still. Flee Not Combat packages (procedure 34) are not
//!   carried out (`fnv_ai::goal`), so only combat flights cower.
//!
//! Not done: the rest of the idle manager (idles chosen from the IDLE tree by their
//! conditions: `PickIdle`, other fidgets), the sounds and other text keys of idle clips,
//! and package idles of actors that are not residents. The props idles hold (ANIO) are
//! drawn by `anim_objects.rs`.
