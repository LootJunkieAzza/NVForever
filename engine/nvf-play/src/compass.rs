//! The marks on the HUD's compass and the discovery of map markers
//! (docs/spec-notes/hud.md §11; owner's playtest list 5, items 12 and 57).
//!
//! - **Actors**: every living NPC and creature of the loaded cells within the player's
//!   Perception × [`ACTOR_RANGE_PER_PERCEPTION`] gets a tick on the compass at its
//!   bearing: amber (the HUD's colour) for the others, red (the crime colour) for those
//!   hostile to the player — fighting the player or ready to attack it, as the enemy
//!   health bar decides (`crate::hud_target`) [observed: the owner's screenshots in
//!   C:\fnv-private\Creature Markers, a red tick over a gecko, an amber one over an NCR
//!   trooper; the pictures are the HUD file's `compass_npc_icon`, `glow_hud_tick_mark.dds`].
//!   An actor that sneaks (as IsSneaking reads it) gets none (`fnv_game::Game::compass_shows`)
//!   [observed: the owner, 2026-10-23].
//! - **Map markers**: every map marker of the worldspace within Perception ×
//!   [`MARKER_RANGE_PER_PERCEPTION`], while the player is outdoors: a hollow triangle
//!   until the player has been there, a filled one after [observed: the owner's
//!   screenshots in C:\fnv-private\Map Markers; the pictures `glow_hud_compass_landmark`
//!   and `…_landmark_discovered.dds`].
//! - **Discovery**: the Pip-Boy's DATA page notes the markers the player comes within the
//!   radius of (`crate::pipboy::data`); each new one shows "You have discovered" over its
//!   name where quests are announced (`crate::quest_messages`), and gives the player
//!   `iXPRewardDiscoverMapMarker` experience [observed: 10 in FalloutNV.esm, and "+10 XP"
//!   on the owner's screenshot]. A save keeps the markers found.
//! - **Quest targets**: the active quest's marked targets (the Pip-Boy's, whose
//!   conditions pass: `crate::pipboy::data::refresh_quest_targets`) at any distance, as
//!   `glow_hud_compass_objective_marker.dds` drawn over the others [documented:
//!   `menus/prefabs/hudtemplates.xml`, `template_compass_icon_quest`: that picture,
//!   40 × 50 at y 5 as the map marker's, depth 5 over the map marker's 3]. A target in
//!   another place (an interior, or another worldspace) is marked at the door of the
//!   player's place that starts the way to it through the fewest load doors, avoiding
//!   locked ones unless the target ignores locks (`fnv_game::quest_targets::DoorGraph`)
//!   [hypothesis: the shortest way; the GECK wiki says the marker "will attempt to avoid
//!   locked doors if possible"] (docs/spec-notes/hud.md §11). The original's compass
//!   shows no distance: its icon file sets `_Distance` and nothing reads it [documented:
//!   `menus/prefabs/compassicon.xml`].
//! - The ranges are guesses: no game setting for them is in the masters [hypothesis].
//! - Who and what is near is looked at ten times a second ([`gather`], [`CompassNear`]);
//!   where each mark stands on the compass is worked out every frame from the camera's
//!   heading, the player's place and the actors' moving bodies ([`place`]), unrounded,
//!   so the marks move as smoothly as the strip (T12d) [design: at ten places a second,
//!   and in whole units, they stepped while the player turned or the actors walked,
//!   where the original's glide, the owner's play of 2026-10-29].
