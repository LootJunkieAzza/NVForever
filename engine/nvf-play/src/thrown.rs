//! Thrown weapons land and can be picked up again (docs/spec-notes/combat-rules.md §11b).
//!
//! - **Which** [documented: GECK wiki Projectile, "Can be Picked Up: If checked,
//!   projectile can be picked up by the player character after it has been disabled, or
//!   regardless of it if Can be Disabled isn't enabled"]: a projectile whose PROJ has the
//!   flag and neither "Can Be Disabled" nor an explosion
//!   (`fnv_combat::data::ProjectileStats::lands_as_weapon`): the throwing knife, hatchet,
//!   spear and tomahawk of the masters. Mines and C-4 have both flags and stay
//!   `crate::mines`'s.
//! - **As what**: the weapon thrown (the shot's weapon, when that weapon fires this PROJ),
//!   else the PROJ's Default Weapon Source ("if they can be picked up by an NPC or the
//!   player they will be added to inventory as that weapon" [documented: GECK wiki
//!   Projectile]).
//! - **Where** [hypothesis: the game's own placement is not documented]: one that struck
//!   an actor goes into that actor's inventory, to be taken from the body; one that struck
//!   anything else lies where it struck, [`OFF_SURFACE`] out from the surface, turned the
//!   way it flew; one that flew its whole range lies where it ended. A created reference
//!   of the weapon (`fnv_sim::World::place`) in the thrower's cell, drawn and given
//!   collision by `crate::dropped` (it falls and settles under its model's collision) and
//!   taken by activation like any loose item. It belongs to nobody [design].
//! - The GECK wiki's Projectile page notes the flag "doesn't appear to work with Missile
//!   type projectiles"; the masters' thrown weapons are Missiles that set it, so it is
//!   followed here (docs/owner-review.md asks the owner what the game does).
//!
//! A `thrown summary` line at the end; one `thrown:` line per landing.
