//! Pickpocketing in play (docs/spec-notes/pickpocket.md; the rules are
//! `fnv_game::pickpocket`).
//!
//! - E on a living actor while the player sneaks shows **Steal** (`crate::activate`) and
//!   opens [`OpenPickpocket`]: the container menu on the actor's inventory in its steal
//!   mode (`crate::menu::model::Steal`), equipped items not listed.
//! - Each take or placement rolls against its chance, shown under the menu. A failed
//!   roll closes the menu: the victim says Pickpocket and turns on the player, and will
//!   not be pickpocketed again ("<name> has already caught you.", `sNoPickPocketAgain`).
//! - A take that succeeds is theft (karma, Pockets Picked). A grenade or mine placed in
//!   the pocket (a weapon whose projectile explodes and has Alt. Trigger [documented: GECK
//!   wiki Projectile notes]) goes live, but not on a child or an essential actor: after
//!   `fProjectileInventoryGrenadeTimer` its explosion goes off where the victim stands
//!   (Pants Exploded), killing it when the explosion hurts its kind
//!   (`Game::explosive_harms`: a pulse grenade kills a robot, not a man); its blast hurts
//!   others as a thrown one's does [hypothesis]. Until then the victim panics: it plays
//!   the idle tree's panic idle (`Game::panic_idle`, `nvforever`'s idles) and stands
//!   where it is (`nvforever`'s residents). Each plant reserves its unit in the pocket
//!   (`Extra::live`): the pocket lists it as "<item> (Armed)" (`menu::model::LIVE_NOTE`)
//!   and nobody takes, uses or drops it until its blast (#1640 item 5).
//!
//! Logged: `pickpocket: open on …`, `pickpocket: took …`, `pickpocket: caught by …`,
//! `pickpocket: planted …` (or `placed … not live on …`), then `pickpocket live check: <item>
//! on …: row "<the open pocket's row, as listed> x<count>", reserved=<live units>
//! ordinary=<other units>` (`row "no row"` when the pocket does not list it),
//! `pickpocket: … explodes in …'s
//! pocket: it dies` (or `: it lives, the explosion does not hurt its kind`), and at exit
//! `pickpocket summary: …`.
