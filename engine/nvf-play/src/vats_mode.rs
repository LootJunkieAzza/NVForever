//! VATS mode (docs/design/vats-mode.md): NVForever's own VATS, a Dead Eye-style slow-time
//! mark and fire, not the original's [design: combat is not a parity target].
//!
//! - **Enter** (§3): V (`Control::Vats`) with a gun in hand, not reloading or jammed, a
//!   round loaded and the AP for a shot. With the weapon away V draws it first and enters
//!   once it is out.
//! - **Marking** (§6, §7): the clock runs at [`MARK_SCALE`] (eased in over the swipe,
//!   [`time_scale_at`]); left click (Use) marks the actor under the crosshair, on the body
//!   part the crosshair's ray strikes; each mark reserves the shot's AP
//!   (`fnv_combat::vats::MarkQueue`: no more marks than the AP left and the rounds loaded
//!   allow). A tap of right click (Block, let go within [`UNMARK_TAP`] real seconds)
//!   takes the last mark back, or with none ends the mode; held, it aims down the sights
//!   (§11.5); V again ends it; E (Activate) fires.
//! - **Firing** (§9): the clock runs at [`FIRE_SCALE`] (half speed); every
//!   [`SHOT_INTERVAL`] of game time the next mark in
//!   order: the view snaps to it, the hit is rolled on the mark's chance (§17) and
//!   `crate::combat` fires one shot straight at it, or wide of it on a miss
//!   ([`VatsMode::take_shot`]: no spread, no recoil, no jam, whatever the weapon's
//!   cooldown), and its AP is spent. [`AFTER_LAST`] after the last shot the mode is off
//!   and the clock is back at 1. In first person the player's own aim stays (a scope
//!   stays up); in third person a gun with sights is raised for a mark farther than 20 m
//!   and fired from the hip nearer, as the NPCs do (`crate::combat::aims_down_sights`).
//! - **The look** (§5): the swipe, the amber grade and its fading out are four numbers
//!   ([`VatsMode::look`]) the renderer's image-space pass draws (nvforever
//!   `imagespace.rs`); the marks' "x"s are drawn here ([`draw_marks`]).
//! - **Hit chance** (§17): each mark's chance to hit (`fnv_combat::vats::raw_chance`,
//!   `final_chance`: the part's BPTD To Hit Chance, the weapon's skill, the spread at the
//!   mark's distance, the player's to-hit perks, Concentrated Fire, the 95 % cap) is worked
//!   out again every frame and drawn as "NN%" beside its "x" ([`draw_labels`]).
//!   Before marking, the actor under or nearest the crosshair shows every body part's
//!   chance on the part, the same work as a mark's ([`spot_on`]), the part under the
//!   crosshair bracketed and brighter ([`draw_previews`], §17.5).
//! - **Helpers and AP perks** (§18): with Mysterious Stranger or Miss Fortune, a mark's
//!   attack may bring the helper beside the player, who fires one shot of their own
//!   weapon at the mark (an `ActorFire`) and fades away; Friendly Help doubles the odds.
//!   Grim Reaper's Sprint gives AP back after a sequence that killed; Nerves of Steel
//!   speeds the AP's regeneration.
//! - **Sounds** (§10): the base game's `UIVATS*` SOUN records, found by Editor ID.
//! - **AP** (§7.2): reserved while marking (the HUD's bar shows what is left after the
//!   reservations, [`VatsMode::reserved`]), spent per shot; outside the mode spent AP comes
//!   back at `fActionPointsRestoreRate` × the maximum a second [hypothesis].
//! - **Scripts** (§12): `fnv_game::Game::set_vats` each frame (GetVATSMode, GetVATSValue).
//! - **Beyond single shots** (§16): an automatic weapon fires a burst a mark
//!   (`fnv_combat::vats::Volley::bursts`); a melee or unarmed weapon marks within 5 m and,
//!   firing, puts the player beside each mark and swings once (`fnv_combat::vats::MeleeRun`,
//!   [`stand_beside`]; the swing is combat's own, [`VatsMode::take_swing`], landing on the mark,
//!   [`VatsMode::melee_mark`]); a grenade or thrown weapon is thrown on the low arc that
//!   lands on each mark (`crate::combat::fire`, `fnv_combat::vats::lob_dir`).
//! - Any menu, a conversation (a forced greeting too), death, a script disabling the
//!   fighting controls or the weapon leaving the hand ends the mode (§9.3, §11.6), and so
//!   does any action but marking, aiming and accepting ([`LEAVING`]: E with nothing
//!   marked activates what is under the crosshair, Wait, Jump, Sneak, the hotkeys…); a
//!   weapon that does not come out within [`DRAW_LIMIT`] gives up entering (§11.8).
//!   Nothing of it is saved (§11.7).
//!
//! Log lines (smoke tests read them): `vats mode: on (…)`, `vats mode: refused: …`,
//! `vats mode: marked …`, `vats mode: mark refused: …`, `vats mode: unmarked …`,
//! `vats mode: firing …`, `vats mode: shot k of n …` (`burst`, `throw`, `swing` for the
//! other kinds, and `closing on …` before a swing), `vats mode: preview …`, `vats mode: off (…)`, and at exit
//! `vats mode summary: …`.
