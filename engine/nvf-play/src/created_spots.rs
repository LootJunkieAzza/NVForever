//! Where actors that scripts create (PlaceAtMe of an NPC, creature or leveled actor list)
//! first stand (docs/design/frame-rate-audit.md §2).
//!
//! PlaceAtMe puts every reference it makes at the caller's own position (`fnv_game`
//! `place_at_me`: the distance and direction do nothing and the object lands near the
//! caller [documented bug, catalogue notes]). For an actor that is a bad place: the
//! Goodsprings schoolhouse's mantis ootheca (`V22MantisOotheca`, script `0x000EF406`)
//! places 3 nymphs in each of four directions at each of its two destruction stages, 24
//! nymphs at the egg's centre, against the lockers [observed: `fnvtool script decompile`,
//! `world refs`]. Their characters started on or inside the egg and the lockers and the
//! character controller ran out its iterations every step for every one of them: about a
//! second a frame (frame-rate-audit.md §2).
//!
//! So a newly created actor is moved, before the engine first takes it up, to the nearest
//! spot around where it was put that [engineering choice; the game's own rule is not
//! known, it "lands near the caller"]:
//! - has a walkable support under it that is not the caller itself, with room on it for
//!   a person's capsule (the player's, as the arrival rule tests it, `player::safe::stand`)
//!   or, when no spot has that, for a small creature's ([`SMALL`]);
//! - is no more than [`MAX_RISE`] above where it was put (on the floor, not on a desk or
//!   a locker beside it);
//! - is in sight of where it was put (a ray at knee height meets nothing but the caller),
//!   so nothing appears behind a wall;
//! - is at least [`SPACING`] from every other created actor and every actor's character,
//!   so they do not start inside each other.
//!
//! The spots are tried on rings ([`RADII`], [`DIRECTIONS`] a ring), nearest first. An actor
//! with no such spot within the last ring stays where it was put. The caller is the
//! reference standing exactly where the actor was put (PlaceAtMe copies its position);
//! there is none when a script placed it at a marker.
