//! The ITEMS page (docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md §4): the player's inventory, one tab per
//! kind of item (Weapons, Apparel, Aid, Misc, Ammo), over the inventory model
//! (`menu::model`, `Mode::Inventory`).
//!
//! Lengths are the canvas's, from the menus' rectangle (`frame::MAIN`) as
//! `menus\main\inventory_menu.xml` gives them [documented] unless marked otherwise.
//!
//! - The heading's cards: Wg (carried weight / what the player can carry), HP, DT and
//!   Caps [observed: the owner's screenshots; documented: their places].
//! - The list: one row per stack, its name in font 2 with the count in brackets, a filled
//!   square before what is equipped; the selected row boxed.
//! - Keys: Up/Down (W/S) select, Enter or Space equip, unequip or use; the wheel
//!   scrolls; a left click on a row selects it, a left click on the selected row acts on
//!   it. A right click on a row drops one (a stack asks how many), Shift + right click
//!   the stack [design: owner 2026-11-02, #1393]. The keyboard has no drop key: X is the
//!   original's PC key for Mod (`IM_ModButton`), and X on the controller is its drop
//!   button (`IM_DropButton`'s `&xbuttonx;` [documented: inventory_menu.xml]), which
//!   drops one here when the controller works the controls.
//! - The scroll bar at the list's left, only while the list is longer than its window:
//!   the arrows at its ends and a line for the part shown [observed: the owner's scroll
//!   screenshot; the DATA lists' bar, `data::scroll_bar`].
//! - The selected (pointed at) item at the right: its picture (`IM_ItemIcon`, 450, 10,
//!   380 square) and its figures (`IM_ItemInfoRect`, 385, 340, 446 × 150, three cards a
//!   row of a third of it, 10 apart, a third of its height high, `item_stats_display.xml`)
//!   [documented: places]: [`info_tiles`].
//! - A weapon's skill badge (`IM_ItemIconBadge`, 390, 260, 64 square): the picture of
//!   the skill the weapon uses (`weap_skill_icon_*.dds`), and beside it the skill it
//!   needs (`IM_StrReq`, 440, 300, font 7, left), "0" too [documented: places; observed:
//!   the owner's ITEMS screenshots, Guns 0/25/50 under the bullets, the Throwing Spear's
//!   Melee Weapons 25 under the knife]. Not on the ITEMS page: DPS (the original shows
//!   none there, and the badge takes its place over DAM [observed]); the container and
//!   barter figures keep it ([`weapon_dps`]).
//! - "Mod X)" (`IM_ModButton`, `sInventoryMod`) on the Weapons tab, bright for a weapon
//!   with mod slots: the mod menu attaches and removes mods [documented: key; hypothesis:
//!   when it shows; design: always bright, the owner's rule 2026-10-27]. X on it opens the
//!   mod menu (`super::item_mod`, weapon-mods.md §5); elsewhere X does nothing, and the
//!   hint is dim (#1896).
//! - The hints at the top right, one under the other ([`page_hints`], #1896), by the input
//!   device. With a controller the original's whole column [observed: the original's
//!   screenshots on issue #1896, taken with a controller connected]: the equip action
//!   ("Equip", "Unequip" on what is worn, "Use" on aid; A), "Drop" (X), the repair action
//!   ("Repair" / "Maintain", Y, `super::repair`), "Hotkey" (a held key 1-8 and a click)
//!   and, on Weapons, "Mod" (LB). With the keyboard and mouse only "Repair R)" /
//!   "Maintain R)" on every tab and "Mod X)" under it on Weapons [observed 2026-11-09: the
//!   original's InventoryMenu button tiles read with keyboard and mouse on each ITEMS
//!   tab: the equip, drop and hotkey buttons hidden on every tab, the repair button shown
//!   on every tab, the mod button on Weapons only]; Enter, the right click and the number
//!   keys still do what they do, only their hints go. The set follows the device as it
//!   changes (the Controls page's Input Device). The first row at the Repair button's
//!   place (`IM_RepairButton`, y 45 [documented]), the rows `frame::HINT_PITCH` (46)
//!   apart, each word right-aligned at 855, the heading's right end, with its key after
//!   it (`frame::Ctx::hint_column`) [observed: the same screenshots: the first row just under the heading's cards, the
//!   words ending at the heading's right end, rows 0.90 of the list's row step apart;
//!   design: a column whose keys would run off the screen (a long key name) moves left as
//!   a whole]. They are drawn over the item's picture, whose documented box
//!   they share (as the original's words do), so the picture never hides them. A hint that
//!   does nothing for the selected item is drawn dim: repair on what nothing repairs,
//!   equip when the game would refuse it (`model::enter_acts`: misc, ammo, a book that
//!   teaches nothing, a broken weapon), hotkey on what a hotkey cannot hold, drop on a
//!   quest item [design]. The words are the settings `sInventoryEquip`, `sInventoryDrop`,
//!   `sInventoryHotKey`, else NVForever's labels for them (`fnv_ui::strings`); "Unequip"
//!   and "Use" are NVForever's own, no setting named.
//! - A modded weapon's figures are its modded ones (`WeaponStats::modded`).
//! - While a hotkey's key is held, the hotkey panel stands in the picture's place and a
//!   left click (or Enter) puts the row's item in that slot (`super::hotkey_panel`).
