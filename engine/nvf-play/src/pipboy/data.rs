//! The DATA page (docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md §5.3): Local Map, World Map, Quests, Misc
//! (notes) and Radio, laid out as `menus\main\map_menu.xml`.
//!
//! - **Heading**: the place the player is in and the game's date and time
//!   ([`model::date_time`], [`read::place_name`]).
//! - **Quests**: the quests with an objective shown, running ones first, newest on top
//!   ([`model::sort_quests`]); the active quest's square filled, those done dimmed; the
//!   selected quest's objectives at the right, each behind a square, filled when done.
//!   A click or Enter makes a quest the active one.
//! - **Misc**: the player's notes (AddNote) by name and the selected note's text; an
//!   image note's picture; an audio note's time remaining and
//!   meter, its marker moving while that note plays (at the right end, nothing left,
//!   for a note not playing). Using an audio note plays it from its start, using the
//!   one playing pauses it and goes on (`crate::holotape`). The notes' filter (X,
//!   `sShowActiveNotes`) keeps the notes of the active quest.
//! - **Radio**: the stations the Pip-Boy receives here (`crate::radio`'s list), the
//!   playing one's square filled; a click or Enter tunes to a station or, on the playing
//!   one, turns the radio off; the waveform panel at the right (a trace that runs to the
//!   left and rises with the sound while it plays, the flat line while it is off;
//!   [`wave_moves`]).
//! - **World Map**: the worldspace's map picture with the map markers the player knows
//!   (found within their radius, made visible by ShowMap or by their flag), the active
//!   quest's markers and the player's arrow; dragged to pan, the wheel zooms; the
//!   highlight box follows the pointer and takes a marker's name when over one. A click
//!   on a marker — or the controller's A on one — asks whether to fast travel there, in
//!   a box over the map ([`travel`],
//!   docs/spec-notes/fast-travel.md).
//!   The picture's place, the pointer's window and the controller's cursor come from one
//!   viewport ([`view::MapView`]) that the page drawn from `map_menu.xml` paints from too
//!   (`crate::tiles::map_menu`, which publishes its window as laid out, [`DataState::publish_map`]);
//!   over that page the question boxes are painted by [`popup_over_tiles`]. The Local Map
//!   reads the same viewport, with its own projection ([`view::LocalProjection`]).
//! - **Local Map**: the doors leading elsewhere, the known map markers and the quest
//!   markers around the player, with the player's arrow, over an outline of the place
//!   made from the physics world's collision ([`outline`]; the original's picture of the
//!   place from above is not drawn). Indoors the map is drawn closer
//!   ([`outline::INTERIOR_SCALE`]).
//! - **Place Marker** (#1954, [`marker`]): the maps' X button (X, the controller's X, a
//!   click on its hint) asks, in the same question box, whether to set the player's one
//!   custom marker at the highlight box, or to move, remove or keep the one placed. Both
//!   maps show it (the game keeps it, `fnv_game::Game::custom_map_marker`, so scripts'
//!   SetCustomMapMarker shows too, and it is saved), and the World Map draws dotted lines
//!   from the player's arrow to it and to the active quest's targets.
//! - Both maps pan while the left button is held on them and the pointer moves (the
//!   pointer's own movement, not Bevy's drag: the map's nodes are drawn again as the
//!   highlight box follows the pointer, which ended a drag at once).
//! - On a controller the right stick moves the highlight box — pushed past an edge it
//!   pans the map ([`scroll_map`]) — and the left stick's up and down zooms in and out
//!   smoothly while held ([`stick_cursor`], [`stick_zoom`]).
//! - The right pane's objectives (Quests) and note text (Misc) scroll as one
//!   ([`scroll_pane`]): Page Up/Down (a controller's LB/RB) a window, the wheel over the
//!   pane, and on a controller the right stick smoothly while held; a new quest or note
//!   starts at the top. Their scroll bars take the pointer ([`bar_spots`]): an arrow
//!   steps, the track above or below the marker pages, the marker drags.
//!
//! Selection: Up/Down (W/S) and the pointer (the row under it is selected and boxed);
//! the test aid's `key=down|up|use` steps (`crate::menu::MenuInput`) do the same here.
//! Everything the page shows is gathered into a [`View`] each frame and drawn again only
//! when it changed. The page's state is [`DataState`], made on first use (the Pip-Boy's
//! plugin knows only [`draw`]).
