//! The Local Map's outline of the place (docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md §5.3; the owner's
//! playtest list 5, item 52: "the local map is not rendering anything").
//!
//! The original renders the area from above [observed: its Local Map screenshot]; this
//! draws a plan of the collision the physics world holds instead [design]: a grid of rays
//! cast straight down, a few hundred a frame until the grid is done, then one picture.
//!
//! - **Indoors** the rays start a little over the player's head ([`INTERIOR_START`]) so
//!   the ceiling and the floors above are not seen; a sample whose ray lands near the
//!   player's feet is floor, one landing higher is something standing on it (furniture,
//!   a counter), one landing nowhere (or far below) is outside the rooms. The floor is
//!   filled faintly, what stands on it a little brighter, and the edge between the rooms
//!   and the outside (or a step up of [`EDGE_STEP`]) is drawn bright: the walls.
//! - **Outdoors** the rays start high over the player ([`EXTERIOR_START`]); the ground is
//!   shaded by its slope as lit from the north-west, and a step of [`EDGE_STEP`] between
//!   neighbours (a building's wall, a cliff) is drawn bright.
//!
//! What is not loaded in the physics world (cells far off) stays empty.
