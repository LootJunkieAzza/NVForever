//! The Pip-Boy device's screen treatment (docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md §3), one owner around
//! the shared image ([`PipBoyScreen`]), so that whatever paints the pages into it gets the
//! same screen: the undercoat (the screen camera's clear colour), the background picture
//! under the pages, the scanlines over them, and the coefficients the body's material
//! (nvforever `pipboy_arm.rs`) puts the image and the glare on the model with.
//!
//! A static fit, all its numbers in this file. Its shape comes from a capture of the original
//! [observed: private job pipboy_special_device_base: 1280 × 720, noon in Goodsprings, level
//! view, the STATS page, 11 × 11 pixel means at eight empty places of the screen and on a filled
//! bar]: the falloff to the edges is the background picture's, and the glow across the top and
//! the patch on the right are the glare's, so the undercoat is left with next to nothing. Its
//! levels and tone are fitted to playtest shots of the original at 1920 × 1080, brighter than
//! that capture [observed: 2026-11-05, pipboy.md §3]. `ScreenLit:8` has no part in it:
//! `screen.dds` is black, `Screen_n.dds` flat and its specular colour black [observed: the
//! files; `fnvtool nif decode`], so it stays hidden. None of this is lit by the world [design:
//! both shapes are unlit]. Other hours and custom colours are not measured. Flicker is not
//! built; the page change's wash, shudder and vertical hold are `transition.rs`'s.
//!
//! One moving layer: the beam ([`ScreenFxBeam`], [`sweep`]), a wave of light that travels down
//! the screen every [`BEAM_PERIOD`] seconds: a hard leading edge at its foot and a long fade
//! behind it [observed: private jobs pipboy_special_device_motion and pipboy_fx_still; playtest
//! 2026-11-05]. It lies over the pages and under the scanlines, so the lines cross it. Between
//! sweeps it is hidden. Its picture carries a dither, so its slow rise does not quantise into
//! bands in the 8-bit image ([`beam_pixels`]).
//!
//! Two parts are the screen material's, on the model only (nvf_assets `nif_material.wesl`
//! `pipboy_picture`, through `transition::ScreenLook`): the text's edges softened
//! ([`TEXT_SOFTEN`]) and a fine noise new every frame ([`SCREEN_NOISE`]).
//!
//! The path from the image to the frame [design: `pipboy_arm.rs`, `nvf_assets::nif_spawn`
//! `unlit_vertex_colors`, `imagespace.wesl`]: image × [`SCREEN_TINT`] ×
//! [`SHAPE_VERTEX_COLOUR`], plus the glare's texel × [`GLARE_LINEAR_SCALE`] ×
//! [`SHAPE_VERTEX_COLOUR`], through the world camera's tone mapping. The scene's image-space
//! grade leaves the screen's pixels alone (`imagespace.wesl`, `SCREEN_MARK`).
//!
//! The Pip-Boy's colour reaches the picture here ([`apply_colour`]), not through
//! `ui_colour::recolour`, which leaves every [`ScreenFxNode`] alone: the picture's tint is
//! raised and divided by its alpha, so it is no brightness of the colour for that to find,
//! and the undercoat is the glass, which keeps its colour.
//!
//! The screen menu (`Frame::Screen`) has none of this: no undercoat, no background, no
//! scanlines, no glass (docs/design/screen-menu.md §2).
//!
//! Tuning on a STATS shot at 1920 × 1080, indoors, the per-pixel median of a few shots so the
//! beam drops out, remeasuring after each change, in this order:
//! - [`SCREEN_TINT`], on a filled bar and on mid-tone ink: scale a channel by the light of the
//!   target over the light of the reading (undo the tone map; near linear in the middle tones).
//! - [`BACKGROUND_BRIGHTNESS`] and [`BACKGROUND_RED`], on the empty screen beside the figure.
//! - [`GLARE_LINEAR_SCALE`], at the top middle, above the figure.
//! - [`UNDERCOAT_LIGHT`], last, only if the far edges stay wrong.
