//! The controller (docs/design/controller.md): its buttons and stick directions, their
//! names, the game's default controller buttons, and the menu keys a controller stands
//! in for.
//!
//! **Which device works the controls** is the player's choice, `Input Device` in
//! `[Controls]` of `NVForever.ini` and the first row of the settings page's Controls tab
//! (`crate::bindings::InputDevice`) [design; owner 2026-10-16: keyboard and mouse, or a
//! controller, "depending on a setting under controls"]. With Controller chosen the
//! controls answer the controller only (`crate::bindings::ControlInput`), the left stick
//! moves, the right stick looks; Esc and the console's key still work.
//!
//! **The game's controller buttons** are the fourth byte `JJ` of each `[Controls]` value
//! of the owner's `FalloutPrefs.ini` (`crate::bindings::GAME_CONTROLS`) [observed
//! 2026-10-09; the byte's meaning is hypothesis, [`game_pad`]].
//!
//! **Menus** read keys, so while a controller works the controls its buttons stand in
//! for them ([`menu_keys`]): Start is Esc everywhere; in a menu (not playing) the D-pad
//! is the arrow keys, A Enter, B Esc, LB and RB, LT and RT Page Up and Page Down
//! [design]. On top of that each menu's own buttons press the key NVForever gives the
//! same button there ([`menu_buttons`]), as the original's menu files assign them
//! (`_xbox_button` on each button tile, e.g. `IM_DropButton` `&xbuttonx;`) [documented:
//! the vanilla menu files, read with `fnvtool ui tree`]; a menu's own button wins over
//! the shared ones (on the ITEMS page LB is Mod, not Page Up).
