//! Drawn height smoothed over steps and bumps (owner's playtest list 7 item 9;
//! docs/spec-notes/physics.md §6.11).
//!
//! The character controller moves a character's feet up a step or down off a bump in one
//! fixed step, and the drawn ground under them (`super::drawn_sink`) can change height
//! from one step to the next as well; drawn there, the body and the camera jumped by the
//! same amount at once. A [`StepLift`] is how far a character is drawn above (or below)
//! where its feet and drawn ground put it: what the drawn height changed by in one fixed
//! step beyond what walking a slope gives is taken up into it, and it goes back to 0 as a
//! critically damped spring, so the drawn height climbs the step smoothly. The feet, the
//! collision capsule and every query stay where the controller has them [design].
//!
//! - **What counts as a slope**: per step, a change of at most the horizontal distance
//!   walked × the slope the character has walked lately (filtered over
//!   [`SLOPE_SECONDS`]), never less than [`BASE_SLOPE`], passes at once; only the rest is
//!   smoothed. So a long hill is drawn as walked, without lag, and a step or a bump is
//!   smoothed. In the air, swimming or put somewhere (a change over [`JUMP`]) nothing is
//!   taken up.
//! - **How fast** [design]: [`OMEGA`] (a step is about 95 % climbed after 0.19 s); never
//!   more than [`MAX_LIFT`] either way.
