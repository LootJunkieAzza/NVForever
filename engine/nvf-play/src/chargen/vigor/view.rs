//! Where the machine sits in front of the player's camera so that it fills the screen as
//! in the original (docs/spec-notes/vigor-tester.md §5).
//!
//! The original's view of the model, fitted to the owner's 1280 × 720 screenshots (7.jpg
//! and 10.jpg: ten points of the label boards, the poster, the lever and the two arrow
//! buttons, 7 px RMS) [observed: fitted]: a camera at model point (0, 78.4, 98.9)
//! looking along −y, tipped 9.15° down, with a vertical field of view of 48.4°. The
//! model's +z is up and its −x is the screen's right.
//!
//! NVForever draws the machine with the player's own camera, given the fitted field of
//! view while the menu is open (`super`). Should the camera have another one, the
//! machine is moved along the view line until the board plane fills the same part of the
//! screen (the lever, nearer the eye, then comes out slightly smaller than in the
//! original when the view is wider). Then the whole is scaled down about
//! the eye by [`SCALE`] so that it stands nearer than the walls of the room around the
//! player and the first-person body [engineering choice; the near plane is 5 units].
