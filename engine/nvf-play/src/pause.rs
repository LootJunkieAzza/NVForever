//! The pause menu: Esc in the world opens it instead of quitting (the original opens its
//! pause menu there [observed by the coordinator playing the original, 2026-10-09]). It is
//! a `PlayState::Menu` like the container and inventory menus, so the world, the game
//! clock and mouse look stop and the cursor is released (`crate::menu`).
//!
//! **The look is the original's** (`crate::start_menu`, the main menu shares it) [owner,
//! todo 5 item 8; observed: the owner's screenshots of the original's pause menu, its
//! settings pages and its quit question, C:\fnv-private\Pause Menu; start_menu.xml]: the
//! pause screen over the held world, the column of entries at the right (Continue, Save,
//! Load, Settings, Quit; the original's Help is left out), the highlight box round the
//! chosen one. A page opened from the column dims the column but for its own entry; a
//! click on that entry again closes the page (back to the column), and a click on Quit
//! while its question is up cancels it [owner 2026-10-16: the entries toggle their page].
//! Up/Down choose, Enter or Space take, a click takes, the pointer chooses the entry it
//! moves onto; Esc resumes; N saves, L opens the load page, S the settings, Q the quit
//! question.
//!
//! **Save** (N) saves to a new slot named `Save <n>` (one more than the highest such name
//! in the saves folder) through `crate::save::SaveRequest`; the line under the column
//! says when it is written. **The load page** (L) shows the chosen save's thumbnail and
//! details (player and level, place and game date, play time, when it was saved) over the
//! saves' rows, newest first (`fnv_save::list`), left of the column. Up/Down (W/S) or the
//! mouse wheel choose, the pointer chooses the row it moves onto, Enter, Space or a click
//! load it through `crate::save::LoadRequest` (nvforever starts again with `--load`); Esc,
//! Backspace or Back go back. Only the chosen save's thumbnail is read and decoded.
//! **Deleting a save** (2026-10-19; docs/design/save-load.md §6.1): Delete (or a click
//! on "Delete  Del)" right of the thumbnail) asks "Delete this save?" there, with "Yes
//! Y)" and "No  N)"; Y, Enter or a click on Yes deletes the chosen save's file from the
//! saves folder and lists the saves again; N, Esc, Backspace or a click on No keep it
//! [documented: the original's load and save menus have a Delete hint,
//! `load_and_save_menus.xml` `save_delete_text`, shown with a controller; design: the key,
//! the question and its place]. Log `pause menu: delete <name>?`, `pause menu: deleted
//! <path>`, `pause menu: delete cancelled`.
//!
//! **The settings page** lists the on/off switches of [`crate::settings`] the original's
//! way: their groups as categories left of the column (Gameplay, World, Display,
//! Graphics, Debug: NVForever's switches, not the original's), the chosen category's
//! switches in the middle over the darkened band, each with ON or OFF as the game is
//! using it now, the chosen switch's note under them, Defaults and Back at the bottom
//! right, the version at the bottom left. Up/Down (or W/S) choose a row within the
//! category, Tab or Page Down the next category (Page Up the one before), a click on a
//! category shows it; Enter, Space, Left or Right flip the row, as does a click on it; a
//! flip acts at once and is kept in `NVForever.ini` (`crate::settings`). A slider's row
//! shows a meter as the "How many?" prompt's (`crate::menu::look`: a ground at a quarter
//! of the colour, tick marks 8 apart as far as the value, an arrow at each end) and the
//! value as a percentage; Left/Right or the arrows move it a step, a press or drag on the
//! meter sets the value under the pointer, and it is kept in the INI too. Defaults puts
//! back every row as the command line left it before the INI was read
//! (`crate::settings::StartStates`; without it, as the page was first shown in this run).
//! Esc or Backspace go back.
//!
//! A list's row (the resolution, `crate::settings::ChoiceList`) shows its choice in a box
//! with a down arrow, as a dropdown [design; owner 2026-10-18]: Enter, Space or a click
//! open the list under it (over it near the bottom), the chosen one boxed; Up/Down (W/S),
//! the wheel and the pointer choose, Enter, Space or a click take, Esc, Backspace or a
//! click outside close it. Left/Right on the row take the choice before or after without
//! opening it. A choice that asks to be kept puts a question over the page: "Keep this
//! resolution?" with the seconds left and Keep / Revert (Left/Right/Up/Down choose, Enter
//! or Space take, Esc reverts, a click takes); unanswered it goes back by itself
//! (`crate::settings::KEEP_SECS`).
//!
//! **The Controls tab**, the settings page's last category [design; owner 2026-10-16:
//! keys can be mapped from the settings], lists every control of `crate::bindings` with
//! its key and mouse button. Up/Down (W/S) choose; Enter, Space or a click on a row make
//! it wait for its new key ("Press a key..."): the next key or mouse button pressed is
//! bound (`crate::bindings::rebind`: a control that had it gets the old one), Esc
//! cancels. Delete clears the row's key; Defaults puts back the game's keys. Each change
//! acts at once and is kept in `[Controls]` of `NVForever.ini`. Tab after the last
//! category goes to Controls and from there to the first again. Its first row, Input
//! Device, switches between the keyboard and mouse and a controller (`crate::pad`);
//! with Controller chosen the list shows and rebinds each control's controller button
//! (kept in `[Controller]`), a row waiting for the next button pressed ("Press a
//! button..."), Start cancelling.
//!
//! **Quit** asks first [observed: the original's question and its choices]: Main Menu
//! (nvforever starts again with `--menu`, [`MainMenuRequest`]), Exit Game, Cancel.
//!
//! **What a menu holds** (docs/design/dialogue.md §8, Pausing). Every menu holds game
//! logic by its own means (`PlayState`, the runtime's menu mode). Whether the picture
//! stands still too is one switch for all of them, [`MenuPause`] (`nvforever
//! --menu-pause living|original`, default `living`): the dialogue screen, the inventory
//! and container menus, a script's message boxes and the menus scripts open [owner
//! decision 2026-10-10]. `original` pauses Bevy's virtual clock while such a menu is
//! open ([`freeze_picture`]), so animations, wind, water and clouds stand still.
//! **The pause menu is the exception: it always holds everything**, in both modes: the
//! picture (the virtual clock), scripts (`script.rs` does not tick under it) and sound
//! (`voice.rs` pauses the lines being said and resumes them).
//!
//! While the virtual clock stands still, what must go on reads [`AidTime`]: the timed
//! test aids, the menus' own timers and the scripts' frame time (MenuMode blocks and a
//! conversation's lines run in real time under an `original` menu). `nvforever
//! --run-seconds` counts real time then as well, so an unattended run always ends. The
//! test aids that act on the world can count from the scripts' first frame instead
//! ([`WorldAidClock`], `NVF_PLAY_AIDS_FROM_SCRIPTS=1`; which aids: `crate::test_aid`).
//!
//! Test aid `NVF_PLAY_TEST_PAUSE=<seconds>:<seconds>[,…]`: opens the pause menu at the
//! first time (as Esc) and resumes at the second (as Esc again, from either page), on
//! the aids' clock. `NVF_PLAY_TEST_SETTINGS=<seconds>:<key>[,…]`: at each time, with the
//! pause menu open, shows the settings page and flips the switch of that key (as a
//! click on its row); `<key>=<value>` sets a slider (e.g. `actor-distance=0.5`) or takes a
//! list's choice (`resolution=1024x768`, as a click on it in the open list); the key
//! `page` only shows the page, `controls` the Controls tab, and `bind:<control>=<input>`
//! (INI names, e.g. `bind:Jump=J`) binds a control there as Enter on its row and that key
//! would, `padbind:<control>=<button>` (`padbind:Jump=RB`) a controller button,
//! `device:<name>` (`device:Controller`) picks the input device, `rumble:1` or `rumble:0`
//! sets the controller's Rumble row.
//! `NVF_PLAY_TEST_PAUSE_MENU=<seconds>:<action>[,…]`: with the pause menu open, `save` (the
//! Save button), `load` (the load page), `down`, `up`, `pick` (Enter on the load page, the
//! quit question, a list's row or its open dropdown, where `down` and `up` move too),
//! `back` (from the load or the settings page, the question or an open dropdown),
//! `defaults` (the settings page's Defaults), `wheel-down`, `wheel-up` (a notch of the
//! mouse wheel on the settings page or the Controls tab),
//! `keep` and `revert` (the keep question's answers),
//! `quit` (the question), `delete`, `yes` and `no` (the load page's delete question),
//! `shot` (a screenshot `pause_<page>.png` in the working folder).
