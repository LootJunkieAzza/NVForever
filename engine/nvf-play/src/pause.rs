//! The pause menu: Esc in the world opens it instead of quitting (the original opens its
//! pause menu there [observed by the coordinator playing the original, 2026-10-09]). It is
//! a `PlayState::Menu` like the container and inventory menus, so the world, the game
//! clock and mouse look stop and the cursor is released (`crate::menu`).
//!
//! **The look is the original's** (`crate::start_menu`, the main menu shares it) [owner,
//! todo 5 item 8; observed: the owner's screenshots of the original's pause menu, its
//! settings pages and its quit question, C:\fnv-private\Pause Menu; start_menu.xml]: the
//! pause screen over the held world, the column of entries at the right (Continue, Save,
//! Load, Settings, Quit; the original's Help is left out), the highlight box round the
//! chosen one. A page opened from the column dims the column but for its own entry; a
//! click on that entry again closes the page (back to the column), and a click on Quit
//! while its question is up cancels it [owner 2026-10-16: the entries toggle their page].
//! Up/Down choose, Enter or Space take, a click takes, the pointer chooses the entry it
//! moves onto; Esc resumes; N saves, L opens the load page, S the settings, Q the quit
//! question.
//!
//! **Save** (N) saves to a new slot named `Save <n>` (one more than the highest such name
//! in the saves folder) through `crate::save::SaveRequest`; the line under the column
//! says when it is written. **The load page** (L) shows the chosen save's thumbnail and
//! details (player and level, place and game date, play time, when it was saved) over the
//! saves' rows, newest first (`fnv_save::list`), left of the column. Up/Down (W/S) or the
//! mouse wheel choose, the pointer chooses the row it moves onto, Enter, Space or a click
//! load it through `crate::save::LoadRequest` (nvforever starts again with `--load`); Esc,
//! Backspace or Back go back. Only the chosen save's thumbnail is read and decoded.
//! **Deleting a save** (2026-10-19; docs/design/save-load.md §6.1): Delete (or a click
//! on "Delete  Del)" right of the thumbnail) asks "Delete this save?" there, with "Yes
//! Y)" and "No  N)"; Y, Enter or a click on Yes deletes the chosen save's file from the
//! saves folder and lists the saves again; N, Esc, Backspace or a click on No keep it
//! [documented: the original's load and save menus have a Delete hint,
//! `load_and_save_menus.xml` `save_delete_text`, shown with a controller; design: the key,
//! the question and its place]. Log `pause menu: delete <name>?`, `pause menu: deleted
//! <path>`, `pause menu: delete cancelled`.
//!
//! **The settings page** (#1953; docs/design/settings-page.md) lists the rows of
//! [`crate::settings`] and the controls of `crate::bindings` in seven tabs, the original's
//! four categories first: Gameplay, Display, Audio, Controls, then Graphics, Tweaks and
//! Debug (`crate::settings_layout` says each row's tab and heading; a row it does not name
//! stays under the group it registered with) [design: #1953]. Left of the column, from the
//! rows' top, the rail lists Search, Changed and the tabs; the chosen tab's rows are in
//! the middle over the darkened band (from near the view's top, as far left as keeps the
//! band clear of the rail:
//! `options_left`, #1210), under dim headings in the page's font (Gameplay: Game, Saving,
//! Dialogue, Camera; Display: Screen, Interface, Performance; Graphics: Picture,
//! Distance, World), which take a line of the window and the scroll bar but are never
//! chosen; each row with its value as the game is using it now, the chosen row's note
//! under them (cut to the lines that fit), Defaults and Back at the bottom right, the
//! version at the bottom left. The view model is `crate::settings_view`.
//!
//! The keys [design: #1953]: Up/Down (or W/S) choose a row of the tab, round its ends,
//! passing the headings; Page Up/Page Down the first row under the heading before or after
//! (a controller's LB/RB; "Previous heading" and "Next heading" over the rows take a click
//! too); Tab the next tab, Shift+Tab or F1 the one before (a controller's RT and LT); F6
//! (Y) puts the keys on the rail, where Up/Down choose among Search, Changed, the tabs,
//! Defaults and Back, Enter (A) takes one and F6 gives the keys back to the rows; a click
//! on a tab shows it. Enter, Space, Left or Right flip a switch, as does a click on it; a
//! flip acts at once and is kept in `NVForever.ini` (`crate::settings`). A colour's red,
//! green and blue rows show only while the colour's list has Custom (`crate::ui_colour`);
//! a row chosen while hidden (a test aid's) gives the choice to its colour's row. A slider's row
//! shows a meter as the "How many?" prompt's (`crate::menu::look`: a ground at a quarter
//! of the colour, tick marks 8 apart as far as the value, an arrow at each end) and the
//! value as a percentage; Left/Right or the arrows move it a step, a press or drag on the
//! meter sets the value under the pointer, and it is kept in the INI too. Defaults puts
//! back every row as the command line left it before the INI was read
//! (`crate::settings::StartStates`; without it, as the page was first shown in this run);
//! on the Controls tab, the controls' keys (or buttons) and the tab's controller rows; on
//! the Changed list, the rows it lists. On the search it is the global Defaults.
//! Esc or Backspace go back.
//!
//! **The search** [design: #1953 point 5]: the rail's Search line (a click, or Enter on it
//! with the keys on the rail) or Ctrl+F anywhere on the page (not while a key is awaited,
//! a dropdown is open or the keep question is up: those have the keys) opens it. Its line
//! over the rows shows "Search:" and the text typed, the keys in it; what is typed (the
//! window's text, `KeyboardInput`, read every frame in `PreUpdate` so nothing typed before
//! comes in late) goes into it, Backspace takes the last letter off, and while it is open
//! the letters are its own: N, L, S, Q, W/S, A/D and Space do nothing else, and the game's
//! controls read no key (`crate::bindings::KeyboardCapture`). It finds every row of every
//! tab whose label or note (in the language shown or in English) or INI key holds each
//! word typed, any case (`crate::settings_view::search`), the Controls tab's own rows too
//! by their label, note and INI name; an empty text lists every row. The results are in
//! the page's order, under dim headings saying where each lives ("Gameplay > Dialogue");
//! a hidden row is listed as the row that stands for it (a colour's channel as its colour;
//! a controller's row, a binding or sensitivity of the device not in use, as Input Device,
//! so it is never edited through the device in use), its note naming what it stands for.
//! Down or Enter put the keys on the results, where they act as on the row's own tab
//! (Enter, Left/Right, a click; Page Up/Down from place to place) and the search stays
//! open; typing again goes back to the text. A frame's keys go in the order typed. Esc,
//! Back or the rail's Back closes it and shows what was listed before, the same row
//! chosen, and goes no further.
//! With a controller the rail's keys pass over Search, which says "Keyboard search": a
//! controller types nothing yet, but works the results a keyboard found.
//!
//! **The Changed list** [design: #1953 point 6]: every row of every tab set away from
//! what Defaults puts back (`crate::settings::changed_rows`: a switch by its state, a
//! slider as it keeps its value, a list by its text as the INI keeps it; hidden and
//! disabled rows too), and the Controls rows away from the game's (each control's key and
//! its controller button, the sensitivities, Invert Y, Rumble, the input device:
//! `crate::bindings::changed_controls`), under headings saying where each lives; "No changed
//! settings." when there is none. Defaults there puts back exactly the rows it lists, the
//! controls' each by itself with no swap (`crate::bindings::restore_rows`); a row that goes
//! back leaves the list and the choice moves to the row after it. Log `pause menu: changed
//! <n> row(s); keys <key>,…` as the list changes, `pause menu: changed defaults; keys …`.
//!
//! A list's row (the resolution, `crate::settings::ChoiceList`) shows its choice in a box
//! with a down arrow, as a dropdown [design; owner 2026-10-18]: Enter, Space or a click
//! open the list under it (over it near the bottom), the chosen one boxed; Up/Down (W/S),
//! the wheel and the pointer choose, Enter, Space or a click take, Esc, Backspace or a
//! click outside close it. Left/Right on the row take the choice before or after without
//! opening it. A choice that asks to be kept puts a question over the page: "Keep this
//! resolution?" with the seconds left and Keep / Revert (Left/Right/Up/Down choose, Enter
//! or Space take, Esc reverts, a click takes); unanswered it goes back by itself
//! (`crate::settings::KEEP_SECS`).
//!
//! **The Controls tab** [design; owner 2026-10-16: keys can be mapped from the settings]
//! lists every control of `crate::bindings` with its key and mouse button. Up/Down (W/S)
//! choose; Enter, Space or a click on a row make it wait for its new key ("Press a
//! key..."; [`Listening`]): the next key or mouse button pressed is bound
//! (`crate::bindings::rebind`: a control that had it gets the old one), Esc cancels.
//! Delete clears the row's key; Defaults puts back the game's keys. Each change acts at
//! once and is kept in `[Controls]` of `NVForever.ini`. Its first row, Input
//! Device, switches between the keyboard and mouse and a controller (`crate::pad`);
//! with Controller chosen the list shows and rebinds each control's controller button
//! (kept in `[Controller]`), a row waiting for the next button pressed ("Press a
//! button..."), Start cancelling. After the controls, Invert Y turns the vertical look
//! upside down, and a slider as the settings page's sets how fast the view turns as a
//! percentage of the game's: Mouse Sensitivity with keyboard and mouse
//! (`fMouseSensitivity`), Stick Sensitivity with a controller (the right stick's look
//! speeds), each kept apart (Left/Right or the arrows a step of `crate::bindings::SENSITIVITY_STEPS`,
//! about a tenth apart, a press or drag on the logarithmic meter the value under the
//! pointer; `crate::bindings::SENSITIVITY_LEAST`..`SENSITIVITY_MOST`, 5%-300%)
//! [design: owner 2026-11-03, #1451; #1632]; with a controller Rumble comes after, then
//! the registered controller rows, Button style and the aim assist's (`crate::pad`,
//! `crate::aim_assist`; shown with the controller only) [design: #1953].
//!
//! **Quit** asks first [observed: the original's question and its choices]: Main Menu
//! (nvforever starts again with `--menu`, [`MainMenuRequest`]), Exit Game, Cancel.
//!
//! **Mods** (issue #976, T11; `crate::tiles::mods`): with `[UI] TileMenus=StartMenu` and a
//! mod's tiles in the start menu (MCM's include), a Mods entry stands before Quit
//! ([`ModsEntry`]). Its page draws the mod's tiles from the tree over this menu, gives them
//! the pointer and keys, and runs the start menu's MenuMode scripts each frame; Esc,
//! Backspace or Back go back to the column [design: owner-review.md #34]. Off by default.
//!
//! **What a menu holds** (docs/design/dialogue.md §8, Pausing). Every menu holds game
//! logic by its own means (`PlayState`, the runtime's menu mode). Whether the picture
//! stands still too is one switch for all of them, [`MenuPause`] (`nvforever
//! --menu-pause living|original`, default `living`): the dialogue screen, the inventory
//! and container menus, a script's message boxes and the menus scripts open [owner
//! decision 2026-10-10]. `original` pauses Bevy's virtual clock while such a menu is
//! open ([`freeze_picture`]), so animations, wind, water and clouds stand still.
//! **The pause menu is the exception: it always holds everything**, in both modes: the
//! picture (the virtual clock), scripts (`script.rs` does not tick under it) and sound
//! (`voice.rs` pauses the lines being said and resumes them).
//!
//! While the virtual clock stands still, what must go on reads [`AidTime`]: the timed
//! test aids, the menus' own timers and the scripts' frame time (MenuMode blocks and a
//! conversation's lines run in real time under an `original` menu). `nvforever
//! --run-seconds` counts real time then as well, so an unattended run always ends. The
//! test aids that act on the world can count from the scripts' first frame instead
//! ([`WorldAidClock`], `NVF_PLAY_AIDS_FROM_SCRIPTS=1`; which aids: `crate::test_aid`).
//!
//! Test aid `NVF_PLAY_TEST_PAUSE=<seconds>:<seconds>[,…]`: opens the pause menu at the
//! first time (as Esc) and resumes at the second (as Esc again, from either page), on
//! the aids' clock. `NVF_PLAY_TEST_SETTINGS=<seconds>:<key>[,…]`: at each time, with the
//! pause menu open, shows the settings page and flips the switch of that key (as a
//! click on its row); `<key>=<value>` sets a slider (e.g. `actor-distance=0.5`) or takes a
//! list's choice (`resolution=1024x768`, as a click on it in the open list); the key
//! `page` only shows the page, `controls` the Controls tab, and `bind:<control>=<input>`
//! (INI names, e.g. `bind:Jump=J`) binds a control there as Enter on its row and that key
//! would, `padbind:<control>=<button>` (`padbind:Jump=RB`) a controller button,
//! `device:<name>` (`device:Controller`) picks the input device, `rumble:1` or `rumble:0`
//! sets the controller's Rumble row, `invert:1` or `invert:0` the Invert Y row and
//! `sensitivity:<percent>` (`sensitivity:150`) the sensitivity slider of the device in use;
//! `tab:<name>` (`tab:Tweaks`, an empty tab too) shows a tab on its first row,
//! `select:<key>` chooses a row without changing it (a hidden one: the row that stands for
//! it), `layout` logs the tabs and each row's place (`settings layout: menu-pause ->
//! Gameplay > Dialogue`), `search:<text>` opens the search on that text with the keys on
//! its results (`pause menu: search "<text>": <n> result(s); keys …`) and `changed` the
//! Changed list [design: #1953].
//! `NVF_PLAY_TEST_PAUSE_MENU=<seconds>:<action>[,…]`: with the pause menu open, `save` (the
//! Save button), `load` (the load page), `down`, `up`, `pick` (Enter on the load page, the
//! quit question, a settings row or its open dropdown, where `down` and `up` move too),
//! `back` (from the load or the settings page, the question or an open dropdown),
//! `defaults` (the settings page's Defaults), `wheel-down`, `wheel-up` (a notch of the
//! mouse wheel on the settings page or the Controls tab),
//! `keep` and `revert` (the keep question's answers),
//! `quit` (the question), `delete`, `yes` and `no` (the load page's delete question),
//! `mods` (the Mods page, when the column has its entry: [`ModsEntry`]),
//! `shot` (a screenshot `pause_<page>.png` in the working folder); on the settings page
//! `heading-down`, `heading-up` (Page Down, Page Up), `tab-down`, `tab-up` (Tab, F1),
//! `rail` (F6), `left`, `right` (the arrow keys), `pad:<button>` (`pad:RB`, `pad:D-Pad
//! Down`: the key the controller's button presses on this menu, `crate::pad::menu_key_at`)
//! and `inspect` (logs the tab, the chosen row, the lines shown, every shown row's key and
//! the words drawn) [design: #1953]. These press the keys they stand for, so they go the
//! keys' way. `search` (the rail's Search), and as real input the next frame, through the
//! window's messages: `type:<text>` (each character's key pressed with its text, so the
//! keys' state has them too), `backspace`, `ctrl-f`; `point:<target>` (the pointer onto the
//! middle of what is drawn: `search`, `search-field`, `changed`, `defaults`, `back`,
//! `heading-up`, `heading-down`, `tab:<name>`, `row:<key>`, `choice:<n>`), `press` and
//! `release` (the left mouse button) [design: #1953].
