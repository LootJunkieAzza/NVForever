//! Kill cameras (docs/design/vats-mode.md §19): when the last marked shot of a VATS-mode
//! run kills its actor, the original's camera shots (CAMS) chosen by its camera paths
//! (CPTH) play, as VATS playback's kill cameras do [documented: GECK wiki CameraShot,
//! "cameras for VATS playback"; the paths and shots are the masters' own].
//!
//! - **When** [design: VATS mode fires its marks in one run (§9), so a kill camera only
//!   follows the run's last mark, not to cut the run short]: from the frame every mark's
//!   attack has started until [`WATCH_AFTER`] game seconds after the mode is off, the last
//!   mark's actor is watched; if it dies, the kill camera starts. An actor already dead
//!   when watched is not.
//! - **Which** (`fnv_game::camera_paths`): the masters' path tree, its conditions run on
//!   the player with GetVATSValue answering about the last shot, known to be fatal
//!   (`Game::kill_outcome`), and the VATS area functions on [`CameraRoom`] measured here
//!   by rays ([`measure_room`]). The shots the path starts on the hit play in turn
//!   (`camera_paths::hit_shots`).
//! - **A shot**: plays for its Max Time in real seconds, no less than [`SHOT_LEAST`]
//!   [hypothesis: "the max time the camera will playback before switching to the next
//!   camera", GECK wiki CameraShot; with nothing to cut to sooner, the most]; the world's
//!   clock runs at its Global time multiplier (the player's and the target's own are not
//!   applied: one clock for the world) and its image space modifier (MNAM) plays.
//! - **Where the camera is** [hypothesis: the shot models hold no reference frame; this is
//!   the frame in which their cameras stand where the shot names say, a front shot in
//!   front of the target and so on; observed on `simplefronthitl03.nif`, at (−59, −226,
//!   18) for a front hit, and `snipercamhit01.nif`]: the model's animated root, in a frame
//!   centred on the actor the shot is held by (its Location: the target or the attacker;
//!   a projectile counts as the attacker) at its middle (the aim point), with +Y the level
//!   direction from the attacker to the target and +Z up. With Position Follows Location
//!   the frame follows the actor, else it stays where it was when the shot began. The
//!   camera looks at its Target actor's middle, moved Target % Between Actors of the way
//!   to the other actor, followed while Rotation Follows Target is set, else as at the
//!   start; the model's own rotation is added as a sway (its turn since its first key). A
//!   First Person Camera shot leaves the view where it is. The camera is kept in front of
//!   what lies between the look point and it.
//! - While it plays the view counts as a third-person one (`PlayerControl::cinematic`):
//!   the player's body is drawn and the first-person arms are not.
//! - It ends early when the player dies, a menu opens or the game is not playing.
//!
//! Log lines: `kill camera: <name> <ref> killed by the last mark: path <EDID> (<FormID>),
//! shots <EDID>, …` when it starts (or `kill camera: <ref> killed by the last mark: no
//! camera path chosen`), `kill camera: shot <k> of <n> <EDID>: …` for each shot, and
//! `kill camera: done (…)` when it ends; at exit `kill camera summary: <n> shown`.
