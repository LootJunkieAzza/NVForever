//!
//! Each frame: keys and mouse become a [`MoveIntent`] and the look angles (Input set);
//! the character is placed on the ground once its cell is loaded, then moved in fixed
//! steps through the `Stepper` (Physics set); the simulation's player reference follows
//! the feet; a player body, when one is drawn, poses itself in [`BodySet`] and gives the
//! eye; the camera (`control::place_camera`) sits at the eye, interpolated between the
//! last two steps, or behind the player in third person.
//! Nothing moves in `PlayState::Menu` (physics time stops). Movement values are
//! [hypothesis] (docs/spec-notes/physics.md §6).
//!
//! Safety nets ([`safe`]): an interior start or door destination with nothing under it
//! moves to the nearest door arrival into the cell; a player who falls out of an
//! interior's geometry goes back to where they last stood. Test aid
