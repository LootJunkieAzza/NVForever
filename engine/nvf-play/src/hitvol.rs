//! Actor hit volumes in play (docs/design/combat.md §5.2, step C3): every placed actor
//! (ACHR, ACRE) that is drawn gets a capsule in the physics world (`fnv_phys::actors`),
//! so shots, melee rays and the crosshair's collision ray can hit it.
//!
//! The capsule is sized and placed from the actor's render bounds each frame [design]:
//! the union of the world-space bounding boxes of the actor's drawn parts; feet at the
//! bottom centre, height the box's height, radius the smaller horizontal half-extent
//! (clamped to [`MIN_RADIUS`]..[`MAX_RADIUS`]). An actor that is hidden, removed by the
//! simulation or no longer drawn loses its volume. Dead actors (the script runtime's dead
//! state, combat C5) are on the DEAD_BIP layer; once a dead actor has a ragdoll in the
//! physics world, the ragdoll's bodies are what rays hit and it has no volume here.
//!
//! **Body parts** (step C8): when the renderer publishes an actor's posed body parts
//! ([`ActorParts`]: for each part of its BPTD, the segments along the part's bones), the
//! actor gets one capsule per segment instead (`PhysWorld::set_actor_parts`), so a hit
//! says which part it struck. A capsule's radius is a share of the actor's size (the
//! largest side of its bounds) by kind of limb ([`limb_radius`], [design]), or the widest
//! of the skeleton's own ragdoll shapes on the part's bones where that is wider
//! ([`PartSegment::radius`]: a robot's body, [observed: Mister Gutsy 21.2 against 14.6],
//! #1536; a human's shapes are all thinner than the shares). Each part's
//! chain of segments is pulled in by that radius at its two ends, so the capsule's caps
//! end at the part's end joints instead of reaching into the next part (the torso's top
//! cap would otherwise cover the lower head) [design]. The torso's lower end (the pelvis)
//! stays: pulled in, it left the hips between the thighs uncovered [observed: the
//! Goodsprings Settler, 2026-10-09].
//!
//! The same bounds and posed parts say where each living actor stands in the player's
//! way (`crate::blocking`); hit volumes themselves do not stop anyone walking.
//!
//! **Which meshes are looked at** (#1388): the bounds walk only the entities with an
//! [`ActorBoundsCandidate`], so not every static and tree of the loaded world. The mark is
//! kept in one place, by the hooks of the immutable [`RefVisual`]: an entity has it when
//! its reference may be an actor ([`SimState::may_be_actor`]), and every entity an actor's
//! bounds can come from has a `RefVisual`, whichever code spawned it. It says nothing of
//! visibility, bounds or the actor's presence, which are read each frame as before, as is
//! [`SimState::is_actor`]: a created reference's base can change under a mark that stays
//! [design]. It is not inherited: a child without a `RefVisual` of its own (the player
//! body, shader overlays, cut-off gore) was never counted, and the children of an actor
//! fading out at a door keep theirs after its root loses its own, as they did.
//!
//! Test aids that only measure (`crate::test_aid`): `NVF_PLAY_TEST_HITVOL_SCAN=1` logs
//! `hitvol scan:` lines, the walk's counts ([`ScanCounts`]) every [`SCAN_LOG_FRAMES`]
//! frames and a summary at exit; `NVF_PLAY_TEST_HITVOL_COMPARE=1` walks every `RefVisual`
//! as well each frame, the walk the mark replaced ([`compare_walks`], in the schedule only
//! then), and logs what the marked walk misses and each actor's meshes and volume as they
//! change (`hitvol compare:`, a summary at exit; what it does not show: [`ScanCompare`]).
