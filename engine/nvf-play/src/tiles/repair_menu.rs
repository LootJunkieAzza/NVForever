//! The Pip-Boy's repair page drawn from `menus\main\repair_menu.xml`, behind
//! `[UI] TileMenus=RepairMenu` [design: repair.md §5.1; the way of `super::stats_menu`; issue
//! #1468]. Off (the default), none of this runs and `crate::pipboy::repair` draws its list in the
//! ITEMS page's body.
//!
//! - **The one decision** ([`RepairTiles::ready`]): the switch on, the repair list open on ITEMS,
//!   the menu's code 1035 up and its tree built, the file's tiles there ([`built`]) and a usable
//!   measured layout ([`usable`]). Painting (`super::draw`), hand-built suppression
//!   (`crate::pipboy::frame::draw`) and input read it and nothing else, and [`settle`] publishes
//!   it each frame before any of them. A pass that fails leaves the hand-built list, says why
//!   once, and is tried again the next frame. The tree is built the frame after the code is set
//!   (`fnv_game::ui_loading::sync`), so the hand-built list stands for the frame the page opens in.
//! - **The rules stay `crate::pipboy::repair`'s**: what is listed, what a part does, when the list
//!   closes, its sounds and log lines. This module writes the [`crate::pipboy::repair::Session`] as
//!   the file's "set in code" traits, and sends [`RepairInput`], as the hand-built rows do. The
//!   keys stay the model's ([`HAND_BUILT_KEYS`]). Only the list's scroll is its own.
//! - **Off any row** [observed: private job run07c_repair_menu, 1280x720]: the original opens with
//!   no row hovered, the highlight hidden and only the item's own cards. The model always has a
//!   row chosen, so that state is the item's row chosen with the pointer on none
//!   ([`RepairTiles::on_rows`]); a pointer leaving the rows chooses the item again, so that Enter
//!   then uses nothing, as on the item's row [observed: the same job, row 0 does not act].
//! - **The three states** the same job read: off any row the broken cards alone; on the item's
//!   row those, the arrow and the choose text; on a part those, the arrow, the fixed cards and the
//!   gains. The brackets stand on the item's row in all three ([`write_brackets`]). What follows a
//!   repair on a part was not seen [hypothesis]: the model's rule stands.
//! - **Page content only**, as `super::stats_menu`: the page paints into the Pip-Boy's image, whose
//!   background and scanlines are the shell's, so `RM_Background` stays hidden in both frames. The
//!   screen menu has no title and its heading line runs on (`super::stats_menu::write_frame_of`).
//! - **Input** ([`feed`], before the scripts): the pointer is the Pip-Boy's own, in canvas units
//!   (`crate::pipboy::PipBoyScreen::pointer`), acting on the page painted last frame.
//! - **The words** (repair.md §5.1, each with its source): the file's settings, a record's name, a
//!   number, and the one line of NVForever's own, [`CHOOSE_WORDS`].
