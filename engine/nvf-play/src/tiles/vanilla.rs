//! T12a: the vanilla HUD drawn from its tiles, behind a switch [design: ui-tile-tree.md
//! §6.2 step 3; hud-xml.md step 5].
//!
//! - **The switch**: `[UI] TileMenus=` in the home's `NVForever.ini`, a comma-separated
//!   list of menu names, empty by default; `HUDMainMenu`, and since T15a `MessageMenu`
//!   and `QuantityMenu` (`super::menus`), and since T11 `StartMenu` (the pause menu's
//!   Mods page, `crate::pause::ModsEntry`, `super::mods`), are acted on. It is
//!   read once at start, from the INI the settings page uses
//!   (`crate::settings::SettingsFile`: an unattended run in the player's own home reads
//!   none). The test aid `NVF_PLAY_TEST_TILE_MENUS=<list>` sets it instead, so a smoke
//!   scenario never writes the player's INI. [`TileMenus`] holds it.
//! - **With the HUD a tile menu**, `super::draw` draws the whole `HUDMainMenu` tree (the
//!   file's tiles, the code-made copies, the mods'; `super::draw::Select::Whole`) and
//!   the hand-built pieces that have a tile-drawn equivalent are hidden ([`DrawnByTiles`],
//!   [`hide_hand_built`]). The pieces whose tiles the engine does not fill yet stay
//!   hand-built and their file and code tiles are not drawn ([`KEPT_PIECES`], none since
//!   the breath meter's `nif` tile is drawn, `super::model`); the mapping is in
//!   docs/spec-notes/hud.md §14.7.
//! - [`write_corners`] gives the corner labels' code-made copies the places the
//!   hand-built HUD sets them at (the captures give none), the ammo type's label its
//!   abbreviation, and the condition row its showing rule, only while the switch is on
//!   [design: the tree's values for mods stay T4's when it is off].
