//! T5 part C: the tiles mods added to `HUDMainMenu`, drawn over NVForever's own HUD
//! [design: ui-tile-tree.md §6.1; what the drawing traits are taken to mean:
//! docs/spec-notes/menu-xml.md §3.1.2].
//!
//! - Which tiles: [`fnv_ui::Ui::mod_added_tiles`] of the HUD, laid out by
//!   [`super::layout`], each item kept only when [`fnv_ui::Ui::mod_tile_drawn`] says it is
//!   the mod's own. Code-made copies (`fnv_game::ui_hud::copies`) never draw. A loose
//!   replacement of the HUD file (or of a prefab it includes) draws the file tiles the
//!   archived copy under it lacks (`fnv_vfs::Vfs::read_archived`,
//!   [`fnv_ui::Ui::archived_name_paths`], read once) [design: #975]; `fnvtool ui
//!   mod-tiles` shows the same choice.
//! - Units: the tree's places are the HUD's interface units, 960 to the view's height
//!   at every size, so `screen()` is 960 × height/width wide [documented: hud.md §14;
//!   `fnv_game::ui_hud::write`]; [`crate::interface::u`] turns them into the window's
//!   pixels (height / 960 a unit), as the current HUD does.
//! - With `[UI] TileMenus=HUDMainMenu` (T12a, `super::vanilla`) the whole menu draws
//!   instead ([`Select::Whole`]), with `zoom`, `tile`, any `texatlas` and the compass
//!   strip ([`Fit`], [`Source`]; menu-xml.md §3.1.3).
//! - The pieces are worked out every frame (a pure function of the tree, [`pieces`]) and
//!   compared with the last frame's, piece by piece, each in its own slot node [design:
//!   the tree's change count moves on every write, so it cannot tell]. A piece only moved
//!   or recoloured (the compass marks while the player turns, the fades and flashes) has
//!   its nodes moved and recoloured in place (T12d); one of another look or size is
//!   spawned again in its slot alone; a piece that comes or goes (a fade reaching 0)
//!   spawns or removes its slot ([`change`]; maintainer's review of #902) [design].
//! - A `tile` picture is one image of its repeats baked at its texels' resolution and
//!   stretched over its box ([`crate::repeat`]), so the bars' ticks stand evenly at any
//!   window size (T12d) [design].
