//! The dialogue menu drawn from `menus\dialog\dialog_menu.xml`, behind
//! `[UI] TileMenus=DialogMenu` [design: ui-tile-tree.md §6.2 step 3; the contract:
//! docs/spec-notes/dialogue-menu.md §6].
//!
//! - **The switch** (`super::vanilla::TileMenus::dialog`): on, with the game's menu files
//!   read, `DialogMenu` is in the tree while a conversation runs (`Game::dialogue`; a
//!   conversation never sets `Game::menu`) and `super::draw` draws its whole tree at the
//!   hand-built menu's stacking level, the hand-built menu (`crate::dialogue_menu`) not
//!   spawned. Off (the default), none of this runs.
//! - **The rules stay in `crate::dialogue`**: it says what the menu shows (`dialogue::view`)
//!   and which choice is selected. This module only writes that into the tree ([`write`]).
//! - **When**: so scripts read what the model says and keep what they write, the model's view
//!   is written at each transition of the conversation, as it happens, inside the runtime's
//!   own work: before a result script of the line runs, when a response moves on and when
//!   choices are offered (`Game::ui_dialogue_hook`, [`boundary`]), which covers a conversation
//!   started or a choice made anywhere, a script's included. A frame's [`publish_system`] does
//!   the same before its scripts, for what the model changes outside a transition. Each trait is
//!   written only when the model's value for it changed: a script's change to a label, an alpha
//!   or a flag stands until the model changes that very thing, and a new selection changes none
//!   of them. [`write_system`], after the scripts, measures, places and decides readiness, and
//!   `super::update` works the tree out to be drawn. A conversation that starts this frame
//!   builds the menu there at the latest, so its first frame is the tiles' too. Placement
//!   ([`place`]) reads the file's evaluated numbers, so they are part of what makes it run
//!   again ([`Placement`]).
//! - **The scroll** ([`place`]) goes by whole rows, as the hand-built menu's [owner choice
//!   2026-11-05: whole rows, as the hand-built menu; the original's 56-unit steps and mid-glyph
//!   clipping, observed in the capture, read as a jump; `dialogue-menu.md` §6.3, §6.6]: the
//!   scroll is the first row shown whole at the window's top, moved a row by the bar's arrows,
//!   by the rows that fit by its page areas and, for a choice the keys move to, by as few rows as
//!   show it whole. Only the window's foot can cut a row. The file still moves the rows by
//!   `_current_value × _scroll_delta`: code writes a delta of 1 and the first row's place as the
//!   value. The prefab's own value counts clicks from 0 in this tree, as the wait and tutorial
//!   menus' do, so the model's is written on every frame.
//! - **Readiness** ([`DialogTiles`], `dialogue-menu.md` §6.5): one decision for the tile
//!   drawing, the hand-built menu and the tile input. A file missing, cut down or restructured,
//!   a template that makes no row with its text, or a text that does not measure gives the
//!   whole hand-built menu: the rows made are unloaded, the reason warned once, and the
//!   preparation tried again next frame, as a font or a file may come.
//! - **The input** ([`follow`]): the tile input feeds the menu while it is drawn, nothing over
//!   it and no pause menu ([`DialogTiles::taking`]), and a pointer's or a script's click comes
//!   back as `crate::dialogue::ViewInput`: a row picks its choice, the pointer coming onto a
//!   row selects it, the click area and the line skip; the scroll bar's arrows and page areas
//!   scroll, which is the view's own. The keys and the wheel stay `crate::dialogue`'s. A click is held to
//!   the screen it was made on, a script's to the one it was queued on (`Click::stamp`), and a
//!   real press while the actor speaks skips once whichever way it arrives.
//! - **NVForever's own tiles**: `NVF_GoodbyeHint` and `NVF_SelectionFill`, from templates
//!   written here (`dialogue-menu.md` §6.4). The hint reads its wording and whether it shows
//!   from the same model and the same "Goodbye hint" switch as the hand-built one.
