//! The Pip-Boy's ITEMS page drawn from `menus\main\inventory_menu.xml`, behind
//! `[UI] TileMenus=InventoryMenu` [design: ui-tile-tree.md §6.2 step 3; the contract:
//! docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md §5.2.1; issues #1513, #1468]. On by default [design, #2215;
//! super::vanilla::TileMenus::for_run]. Off, none of this runs and the hand-built page
//! (`crate::pipboy::items`) draws.
//!
//! - **The one decision** ([`InventoryTiles::ready`]): the switch on, ITEMS showing with the repair
//!   list and the mod menu closed, the menu files read, the file's tiles there ([`built`]), the
//!   tabs made and a usable measured layout ([`usable`]). Painting (`super::draw`), hand-built
//!   suppression (`crate::pipboy::frame::draw`), the prompt and input read it and nothing else,
//!   and [`settle`] publishes it each frame before any of them. A pass that fails leaves the whole
//!   hand-built page, says why once, and is tried again the next frame; after
//!   [`FAILING_PASSES`] in a row, only when what it would show or the tree changes ([`TreeMark`]).
//! - **The rules stay the hand-built page's** (`crate::menu::model`, `crate::pipboy::items`,
//!   `crate::pipboy::repair`, `crate::pipboy::item_mod`, `crate::pipboy::hotkey_panel`). This module
//!   writes values as the file's "set in code" traits and says what a tile stands for; commands,
//!   sounds and events go where the hand-built page sends them. Only the list's scroll is its own
//!   (`super::item_menu`), which the model never had in units.
//! - **The list** is `super::item_menu`'s with one side: the container's path is empty, which no
//!   tile answers to. A scrolled list stands partly outside its window by design, so [`usable`]
//!   asks of the rows whose words lie whole inside it, and of at least one.
//! - **The tabs** are template rows here, unlike STATS' fixed tiles [documented: the file]. Their
//!   words are their settings' where the load order defines them, [`TAB_WORDS`] otherwise
//!   ([`tab_words`]). A tab's `x` follows its inner rect's, which follows `_x`, and the file
//!   leaves `_x` to code [documented: the prefabs; observed: private job run07_inventory, 1280x720]: unwritten,
//!   all five stood at one place, which is what the first run met. So [`place_tabs`] writes `_x` and
//!   `_LeftLineLength` and nothing else; what shows as selected follows `_CurrentTab` in the file. A
//!   tab that does not show is a fallback; one that does not take the pointer is warned of and the
//!   page stays: the keys and the device's knob still turn the tabs.
//! - **The buttons**: on a PC Repair shows on every tab and Mod on Weapons, row or not; Equip, Drop
//!   and Hotkey are a controller's in the file, which NVForever's page does not show either; inside a
//!   Misc folder Cancel stands in Repair's place [observed: private job run07c_inventory, 1280x720, private job run07c_inventory_b, 1280x720]. The original's keyring has
//!   no "Back" row and stands last on Misc: NVForever's rows are the model's, a known difference.
//!   Their commands stay reachable by a script's click.
//! - **Words too wide for their card** give way where the title is still a built-in label: a
//!   plugin's setting stands. [`TIGHT_TITLES`].
//! - **Page content only**, as `super::stats_menu`: the page paints into the Pip-Boy's image, whose
//!   background and scanlines are the shell's, so `IM_Background` stays hidden in both frames.
//!   The screen menu has no title and its heading line runs on [design: the owner, 2026-10-31,
//!   `stats_menu::write_frame_of`].
//! - **The hotkey panel** shows while a hotkey's key is held [design: the owner 2026-10-26, `hotkey_panel`
//!   module notes]: the owner's own panel at the owner's place (`hotkey_panel::draw_over_tiles`), over
//!   the page, whose picture, badge, skill and buttons give way. The file's `IM_HotKeyWheel` stays
//!   hidden: no capture has seen it open, so it is a known difference, and the Hotkey button with it.
//! - **The repair list and the mod menu** have their own files, not read here: while one is open
//!   the page is not eligible and the hand-built body draws it, as it does today.
//! - **The prompt** is `QuantityMenu`'s while the page is ready (`super::menus::quantity_tiled`),
//!   drawn on the window; [`feed`] takes nothing under it.
//! - **Input** ([`feed`], before the scripts): the pointer is the Pip-Boy's own, in canvas units
//!   (`crate::pipboy::PipBoyScreen::pointer`), read and never written here. A row the pointer
//!   moves onto is selected unless the wheel holds the selection; a click on a row sends what the
//!   hand-built row sends (`items::on_row_click`: `Command::Select`, or with a hotkey's key held
//!   the assignment), a right click the hand-built drop [owner 2026-11-02, #1393]. The keys and
//!   the wheel stay `items::keys`' and `pipboy::keys`' ([`HAND_BUILT_KEYS`]); a file's binding acts
//!   for a script's tap, not for a physical press.
//! - **Measuring**: with `NVF_PLAY_TEST_TILE_COUNTS` a line a frame for each pass, `tile counts:
//!   InventoryMenu pass=<early|late> writes=<n> changed=<n> micros=<n>`, the late one with
//!   `rows=<n> rows_in_clip=<n> hit_tests=<n> candidates=<n> pieces=<n>` (`super` module notes).
