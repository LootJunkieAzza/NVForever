//! T15a: the message box and the "How many?" prompt drawn from their files, behind
//! `[UI] TileMenus=MessageMenu,QuantityMenu` [design: ui-tile-tree.md §6.2 step 3;
//! plan: docs/handoff/ui-tile-tree-tasks.md, T15a].
//!
//! - **The switch** (`super::vanilla::TileMenus`): with a menu on and the game's menu files
//!   read, its hand-built drawing is not spawned ([`message_tiled`], [`quantity_tiled`];
//!   `crate::message_menu`, `crate::menu::look::spawn_quantity`) and `super::draw` draws
//!   the menu's whole tree. Off (the default), none of this runs.
//! - **What the model writes** (before scripts, only when what the menu shows changed):
//!   [`write_message`] the box's strings, its icon, one `MM_ButtonTemplate` row per button
//!   and the list's and the box's sizes the file leaves "set in code"; [`write_quantity`]
//!   the meter's stack and amount, from which the file works out the fill and the amount
//!   text. The rules the box follows (what it holds, which button is chosen, the keys) stay
//!   the hand-built menus' (`crate::message_menu::MessagePanel`, `crate::script_hud`,
//!   `crate::menu::model::Quantity`) [design].
//! - **Text sizes**: every text tile of a drawn menu gets its measured `width` and `height`
//!   ([`write_text_sizes`]), as the HUD's measured texts get their width (hud.md §14.1):
//!   the files place the buttons and the list by them [hypothesis: the original's code
//!   writes them; menu-xml.md §3.1.2].
//! - None of the hand-built drawings' copied numbers (`message_menu.rs`'s layout constants,
//!   `look.rs`'s `Q_*`) is read here: the places come from the files. The few numbers this
//!   module keeps are each tagged where they stand.
