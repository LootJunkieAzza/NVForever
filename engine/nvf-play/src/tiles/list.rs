//! T15c: the parts of a `list_box.xml` list a menu's model has to do itself: rows made from
//! a template and kept by what they stand for, their measured places, the scroll counts and
//! the viewport, the highlight, the scrollbar's pieces and the marker's drag. The menu's
//! rules stay outside it: a menu gives its rows' keys and strings, and is told what was
//! clicked (`super::container_menu`).
//!
//! What the prefab leaves to code [documented: `list_box.xml`, "Set in code"; observed: the
//! container capture, barter-menu.md §8]:
//!
//! - **The rows**: a row's `_y` is the sum of the heights above it; its `height` is its
//!   text's height and the template's `_VerticalSpacing`, unless the template gave one. The
//!   file itself moves a row up by `_current_value` × `_scroll_delta` (`list_box_template.xml`),
//!   so nothing here or in the layout subtracts the scroll again.
//! - **The counts** ([`counts`]): what is left over, in rows of the average height and
//!   rounded up, gives the positions after the first; the scrollbar has one item more and 1
//!   visible, and `_scroll_delta` is what is left over by those positions; a list that fits
//!   has 1 item and keeps the file's `_scroll_delta`.
//! - **The highlight**: `_highlight_y` the selected row's place after the scroll,
//!   `_selected_height` its height; -1 and 0 with none, which the file reads as hidden.
//! - **The scroll**: a menu's own state ([`write_value`]). The prefab's `_current_value`
//!   sums the arrows' and page areas' `clicked` from 0 in this tree (an expression starts
//!   from 0, `fnv_ui`), so the value is written again on every frame after the clicks, and
//!   `_SetInCode` poked [documented: scrollbar_vert.xml], as the wait menu's slider.
