//! The Pip-Boy's weapon mod menu drawn from `menus\item_mod_menu.xml`, behind
//! `[UI] TileMenus=ItemModMenu` [design: weapon-mods.md §5.1; the way of `super::repair_menu`;
//! issue #1513]. Off (the default), none of this runs and `crate::pipboy::item_mod` draws the
//! menu in the ITEMS page's body.
//!
//! - **The one decision** ([`ItemModTiles::ready`]): the switch on, the mod menu open on ITEMS,
//!   the menu's code 1061 up and its tree built, the file's tiles there ([`built`]) and a usable
//!   measured layout (`super::repair_menu::usable_of`). Painting (`super::draw`), hand-built
//!   suppression (`crate::pipboy::frame::draw`) and input read it and nothing else, and
//!   [`settle`] publishes it each frame before any of them. A pass that fails leaves the whole
//!   hand-built menu, says why once, and is tried again the next frame. Each change of the
//!   decision is logged with the passes it held (`tiles: ItemModMenu ready: drawn from tiles`,
//!   `tiles: ItemModMenu no longer drawn from tiles after <n> passes: <why>`), so a fallback
//!   that lasts one frame shows in the log too.
//! - **The rules stay `crate::pipboy::item_mod`'s**: what is listed, what a mod does, the
//!   figures and their words (`crate::pipboy::item_mod::compare`), when the menu closes, its
//!   sounds and log lines. This module writes the [`Session`] as the file's "set in code"
//!   traits and sends [`ModInput`], as the hand-built rows do. The keys stay the model's
//!   ([`HAND_BUILT_KEYS`]). Only the list's scroll is its own.
//! - **The rows** (the maintainer's design, 2026-10-27, weapon-mods.md §5): the weapon first,
//!   framed by the file's brackets ([`super::repair_menu::write_brackets_of`]), then its attached
//!   and carried mods, the chosen row under the file's highlight box. A mod's effect stands under
//!   its name as a second line of the row's own words (`ListItemText`): the file's row has one
//!   text, so the effect wraps at the name's width, the file's 270, not the hand-built 338
//!   [design; a known difference, weapon-mods.md §5.1].
//! - **The headline and the description**: the line between the title and the weapon's name is
//!   written (`write_headline_line`), the file's own coming to 0; the description is cut at
//!   the hand-built menu's three lines (`cut_description`), so it stays off the cards below.
//! - **Page content only**, as `super::repair_menu`: the page paints into the Pip-Boy's image,
//!   whose background and scanlines are the shell's, so `WMM_Background` stays hidden. The screen
//!   menu has no title and its heading line runs on (`super::stats_menu::write_frame_of`).
//! - **Input** ([`feed`], before the scripts): the pointer is the Pip-Boy's own, in canvas units
//!   (`crate::pipboy::PipBoyScreen::pointer`), acting on the page painted last frame. A row the
//!   pointer comes onto (once it moved) is chosen, a click on a row asks the model's `Click`
//!   (choose, or on the chosen mod attach or remove it), the Mod button (shown on a controller
//!   by the file) its `Use`, Cancel its `Cancel`; the scrollbar's pieces move the list.
//! - **The words** (weapon-mods.md §5.1, each with its source): the file's settings (the title,
//!   the buttons, the condition cards' titles), a record's name and description, and the
//!   figures' words, the model's.
