//! The Pip-Boy's STATS page ([`TILED_TABS`]) drawn from `menus\main\stats_menu.xml`,
//! behind `[UI] TileMenus=StatsMenu` [design: ui-tile-tree.md §6.2 step 3; the contracts:
//! docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md §5.1.1 to §5.1.3; issue #1513].
//!
//! "run07" and "run07b" in this file are the private jobs `run07_stats_tabs` and `run07b_stats`, the
//! original running at 1280 x 720.
//!
//! - **The one decision** ([`StatsTiles::ready`]): the switch on, one of those tabs showing, the
//!   menu files read, the file's tiles there ([`paths`]), the rows made and a usable measured
//!   layout. Painting (`super::draw`), hand-built suppression (`crate::pipboy::frame::draw`) and
//!   input read it and nothing else, and [`settle`] publishes it each frame before any of them.
//!   Eligible to prepare is not ready to display: a pass that fails leaves the whole hand-built
//!   page, says why once, and is tried again the next frame.
//! - **What the model writes** ([`page`]): values from `Snapshot` and `StatsView`; this module
//!   works no figure out again. Places and sizes are the file's, worked out at run time, from
//!   the text sizes and row heights written here.
//! - **Page content only**: the page paints into the Pip-Boy's image, whose background and
//!   scanlines are the shell's, so the file's `background_layout` stays hidden in both frames.
//! - **General** ([`GeneralPaths`]): both lists hold their rows; `stats_genrep_container/user0`
//!   picks the list and its side, by the file, from `StatsView::reputation` [observed: private
//!   job run07_stats_tabs]. It has no display, so that is left empty. The input acts on the rows
//!   of the list shown ([`Written::rows`]).
//! - **Status** ([`StatusPaths`], [`StatusShown`]): the sub-page by
//!   `stats_status_container/user0`, code writing what the file leaves to it: the limbs' meters
//!   and pictures, the hints' lines, the rads and the effects' rows. The bars and "crippled" words
//!   are the Stimpak's targets on a limb [owner 2026-10-23], which the file does not make them,
//!   as are the limb's picture, and over the head the face, which it does while hurt.
//!   The hand-built page's box on a limb pointed at or chosen has no tile: lost behind the switch.
//!   H2O, FOD and SLP are written on RAD's shape [observed: run07b, the same places and scale].
//! - **The tabs not listed** stay fully hand-built. The menu persists across tabs and reopenings, and
//!   its rows while their list is the one shown ([`Written`]); going to another list unloads
//!   them, as a new tree would, and a new menu tile (a rebuilt tree) starts over.
//! - **A list longer than it shows** scrolls by the model's first row shown
//!   (`StatsView::top`), the file moving the rows from the bar's value and `_scroll_delta`
//!   (`super::list`). So every row of such a list must have one height; a wrapped name leaves
//!   the page to the hand-built one [design: as `StatsView`, whose rows are whole rows].
//! - **The order in a frame**: [`write`] after the tile input, before the scripts, so they read
//!   this frame's model and the scroll outlasts a click's pulse; then `crate::pipboy::stats::prepare`
//!   (keys, test aid, what is shown) and [`settle`], which writes what they changed, works the
//!   tree out and decides, before `frame::draw` and `super::draw::draw`. So a tab change or a key
//!   is drawn in the frame it happens, from one state.
//! - **Input** ([`feed`], before the scripts): the pointer is the Pip-Boy's own, in canvas units
//!   (`crate::pipboy::PipBoyScreen::pointer`: the device's ray or the flat image's crop), acting
//!   on the page painted last frame, what the player saw, with the pointer found this frame
//!   (`crate::pipboy::PointerSet`). A row under the pointer selects and boxes as the hand-built
//!   list does, not one drawn under a pointer that has not moved; that is the tile under the
//!   pointer itself, not the highlight, which a file's `xup` or `xdown` can move. Such a move
//!   selects only for a key the hand-built keys did not also act on ([`keyed_row`]). A
//!   click on a row selects it; a tab sends `PipBoyInput::Tab`; the list's and the description's
//!   arrows, page areas and markers become `StatsView` commands. The values are the model's:
//!   written back after input, and the wheel stays `crate::pipboy::stats::prepare`'s, so nothing
//!   acts twice. A row that comes under a still pointer as the list moves takes the selection,
//!   as the original's does [observed: run07]; a row drawn under one when the page comes up does not. The
//!   keys stay the hand-built ones ([`HAND_BUILT_KEYS`]): a file's binding for one does not act
//!   for a physical press, a script's click does. The screen menu's header stays hand-built, and
//!   no tile lies under it to take its click; nor do the file's hover sounds play here, so a
//!   tab's is `TabHovered`, once.
//! - **A menu over the page** takes the frame's input ([`modal_over`]), for all of the frame it
//!   closes in as well: its key closed it in the scripts, before the page's keys run.
