//! Radios play their station (docs/spec-notes/radio.md): receivers in the world, actors
//! made radios by SetNPCRadio, and the Pip-Boy radio.
//!
//! - **Receivers** are placed activators whose base names a radio station
//!   (`fnv_world::radio`). One plays while it is switched on (`fnv_game::radio`: a default
//!   activation switches it, the "StartOn" scripts activate their radio once on load),
//!   is enabled and is not destroyed (SetDestroyed: Goodsprings' broken radio). A
//!   receiver whose base has neither a script nor a name (the Tops performers'
//!   `marker_audio.nif` speakers, one Gomorrah speaker) starts switched on [hypothesis:
//!   nothing could switch them on otherwise; the player cannot activate an unnamed
//!   activator].
//! - **Actors made radios** (SetNPCRadio: Lily's recording, EDE) play like a receiver
//!   at the actor's position, heard by the station's radio template. The filter the game
//!   puts on lines the actor is not the speaker of is not built.
//! - **The Pip-Boy radio** (`fnv_game::radio::PipBoyRadio`, scripts' PipBoyRadio and
//!   PipBoyRadioOff) plays its station at the listener, with no falloff and the song's
//!   own (stereo) file, not the `_mono` copy [documented: GECK wiki Creating Radio
//!   Stations: the mono file "will be what is played out of speakers and radios"]. It
//!   receives the stations whose base is a radio station without the Non-Pipboy flag,
//!   whose placed reference is enabled and in range ([`fnv_world::radio::reception`]);
//!   a script may tune it to any enabled station in range [documented: GECK wiki
//!   PipBoyRadio: a disabled or out-of-range station "cannot be selected"; observed:
//!   Repcon's launch script tunes the Pip-Boy to its Non-Pipboy station]. There is no
//!   Pip-Boy screen yet: `]` tunes to the next station received (off → first → … → last
//!   → off) and `[` to the previous, unless a script has turned the Pip-Boy off
//!   (DisablePlayerControls) [design]. Turned on without a station it takes the first
//!   one received [design]. Out of range it falls silent until the station is received
//!   again [design]. In a Radius station's static band the station fades into the
//!   `UIRadioStaticLP` loop [hypothesis: the static sound by its name; GECK wiki
//!   Reference: "plays static over this percentage of the radius"].
//! - **The station's programme** is dialogue: its placed reference says the lines of its
//!   radio quests one after another (`Game::radio_next`, begin and end result scripts
//!   run, so the quests' "last played" variables rotate the songs) while it broadcasts
//!   (SetBroadcastState, else the Continuous Broadcast flag). One programme per station,
//!   shared by everything playing it: what starts hearing it mid-line joins at the point
//!   the line has reached [design]. A station's programme starts when it is first heard
//!   and runs on from then, heard or not [design: a station nobody has heard yet runs no
//!   scripts]. A station that stops broadcasting finishes the line it is saying [design].
//! - **The poker table** ([`TableStation`]): its casino's station plays at the listener,
//!   flat, with the song's own file as the Pip-Boy plays it; while it does, nothing else
//!   plays a station [design].
//! - **StartRadioConversation** (`Game::take_radio_conversations`): the conversation
//!   starts at once, heard or not, interrupting the programme's line (whose end script
//!   then does not run) [documented: GECK wiki StartRadioConversation, "interrupt the
//!   broadcast with the new conversation"]; it follows the lines' links until one links
//!   nowhere, and the station then goes back to its programme or, not broadcasting, falls
//!   silent [documented]. A call while the station is still saying a conversation's
//!   line is not taken [design: the NCR Emergency Radio's quest asks every ten seconds].
//! - **Silence and static**: what plays a station that is saying nothing plays the
//!   station's own looping sound (TACT `SNAM`; Hanlon's recording has `OBJRadioStaticLP`)
//!   [hypothesis: GECK wiki SetBroadcastState, off, "the station will play static except
//!   when playing scripted conversations"]; the Pip-Boy plays `UIRadioStaticLP` then.
//! - **What a line plays**: a response with a sound form plays that sound's file — for a
//!   song from a receiver its `_mono.ogg` beside the `.mp3` the record names [documented:
//!   GECK wiki "Creating Radio Stations"; observed: all 48 songs have one in
//!   `Fallout - Sound.bsa`], and the sound wins over a voice file [documented: GECK wiki
//!   Radio Stations]; otherwise the response's voice file in the voice type of the
//!   line's fixed speaker when it names one, else the station's [observed: Black
//!   Mountain Radio's segment lines name Tabitha or Raul Tejada and their files are in
//!   those voice types' folders; the station has no voice type; documented: GECK wiki
//!   SetNPCRadio, a radio plays lines whose speaker is someone else]; with neither, the
//!   line lasts its fitted length in silence.
//! - **Loudness** [design]: the sound's static attenuation (songs, loops), DJ lines at
//!   full level; by distance from a receiver or actor the radio template's (the station's
//!   `INAM`, else the receiver's) minimum and maximum distance and attenuation curve as
//!   `crate::sfx::distance_gain` uses them; without either template 150 and 1800 units
//!   (the AMLRadio template's). Receivers and actors are panned as the sound effects are
//!   (`crate::sfx::Panned`, `SoundAt`); the Pip-Boy plays flat, at the listener. A
//!   receiver is heard only within that maximum distance.
//! - **No subtitles**: a station's talk lines are heard, never subtitled (owner, list 5
//!   item 27).
//! - The Esc pause menu and a loading screen hold the radios and the programmes, as for
//!   the placed loops (`crate::ambient`).
//! - Test aid: `NVF_PLAY_TEST_RADIO=<seconds>:<next|previous|on|off|tune=<station>>[,...]`
//!   presses `]` or `[`, turns the Pip-Boy radio on or off, or tunes it as a script's
//!   `PipBoyRadio 1 <station>` does (a placed station or its base, by Editor ID or hex
//!   FormID). Seconds of the radios' clock: from the first frame the scripts run, less
//!   pauses and loading screens.
//! - Log: `radio: <who> tuned to <station> playing <file>` when something starts a
//!   response or a loop, `radio: <station> says <topic> <info>: …`, `pipboy radio: …`,
//!   and at the end `radio summary: …` and `pipboy radio summary: …`.
