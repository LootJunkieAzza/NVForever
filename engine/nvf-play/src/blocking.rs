//! Actors in the player's way (docs/spec-notes/physics.md §6.8): a living, drawn actor
//! blocks the player where its body is now: on its feet, walking, on a stool or in bed.
//!
//! An actor has no collider for this [design]. Its hit volumes are for shots
//! (`crate::hitvol`; the character controller passes through them), and the bodies of its
//! skeleton model are the actor's own, not the cell's (`fnv_phys::placed`: added at the
//! placement they stayed where the actor was placed). Each frame `crate::hitvol` works
//! out a [`Block`] per actor from what is drawn, and the player's wanted velocity is
//! clipped against the blocks before the character controller moves it ([`clip`]): the
//! player stops at an actor and slides round it, and one caught inside (an actor walked
//! or sat down into the player) is let out and moved out. Nothing here can wedge the
//! character, and rays never meet a block.
//!
//! - **Where** [design]: with posed body parts (`crate::hitvol::ActorParts`), the line on
//!   the ground under the torso's bones, pelvis to neck: a point under a standing or
//!   sitting person, the length of the body under one lying down or a four-legged
//!   creature. Without them, the middle of the actor's render bounds.
//! - **How wide** [design]: [`RADIUS_SHARE`] of the bounds' height round that line (22
//!   units for a person 128 tall, the player's own radius), within [`MIN_RADIUS`] and
//!   [`MAX_RADIUS`]. The bounds' width is not used: it changes as the actor turns.
//! - **Who is left out**: the dead. An actor the character controller walks
//!   (`PhysState::npcs`) has its block where its character is, made anew every fixed
//!   step (`crate::player`), and so has the player for those actors: characters pass
//!   through each other's bodies (`Character::passes_characters`) and this rule alone
//!   keeps them apart. (Left to the controller, a character was carried along by any
//!   other that walked past it within 3.5 units, as on a moving platform.)
//!
//! **Pushing** [design; how far the game's actors move each other is the capture
//! `pc_actor_push`, physics.md §6.8]: an actor that stands still gives way to one that
//! walks into it. Whoever moves the actors says who stands where
//! ([`ActorBlocks::standing`]); such a block is `pushable`, and a walker coming at it
//! keeps [`PUSH_SHARE`] of the speed it comes at it with, the standing actor moving
//! ahead of it at that speed ([`Push`], taken by the actors' owner, which moves the
//! actor as far as it has room). The walkers are the player and the actors the
//! character controller walks; the player's block gives way to those actors when the
//! player stands still on the ground (`crate::player`). An actor on furniture, asleep
//! or on its way is not pushed.
//!
//! Not done: an actor that walks on the navmesh surface (no character) is not stopped
//! by anyone and pushes no one; two actors that both walk do not push each other.
