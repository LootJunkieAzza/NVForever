//! The terminal's screen drawn as the original sets it out (docs/spec-notes/hacking.md
//! §2, §7): the hacking game by `menus\hacking_menu.xml`, the terminal's own menu by
//! `menus\computers_menu.xml`, both in the game's font 5 (`fixedsys_comp_uniform_width`,
//! 17 units a character). [design] A derived dark undercoat and tinted Pip-Boy image
//! retain the glass's texture/vignette beneath the measured foreground colours (§2); the
//! text has the original's soft edges ([`soften`]) and scanlines cross the whole canvas

//!
//! The original draws this into a texture shown on a monitor model
//! (`meshes\terminals\terminalinterface01.nif`, `[RenderedTerminal]` in
//! `Fallout_default.ini`), and so does NVForever: the canvas is drawn into
//! `super::TerminalImage` and the engine puts that on the model's screen (nvforever
//! `terminal_view.rs`), where the texture spans [`TEXTURE_UNITS`] of the canvas. Without
//! the model the picture is drawn flat over the darkened world [design, hacking.md §7].
//! Lengths are the interface's units (960 to the view's height): the owner's screenshots
//! show the screen at almost that scale (0.99).
