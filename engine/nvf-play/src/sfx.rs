//! Sound effects in the game (docs/spec-notes/combat-rules.md §16): SOUN records played
//! on request ([`PlaySound`]), today the sounds of the player's shots: the weapon firing,
//! clicking empty and being drawn or put away, impacts by material, explosions.
//!
//! - **The record** [documented: xEdit SOUN]: a file or a folder under `sound\`, flags,
//!   a minimum and a maximum attenuation distance, a static attenuation in hundredths of
//!   a decibel and a frequency adjustment in percent.
//! - **The file.** A folder stands for the `.wav` and `.ogg` files directly in it; one is
//!   picked at random each time [hypothesis: from the folders holding a few takes of one
//!   sound]. A record names a `.wav`; where the archives hold an `.ogg` of that name
//!   instead, that is the file [observed: 2,184 of the base sound archive's effects are
//!   Ogg Vorbis, the ambient ones above all, docs/spec-notes/audio.md §5]. WAV files of
//!   PCM (8, 16 or 24 bits) and 32-bit float are decoded here, Ogg Vorbis by rodio, both
//!   to samples played through Bevy's audio as a source of our own ([`PcmSound`]).
//!   Other encodings are reported once and not played.
//! - **Off the main thread** (#1428) [engineering choice]: a file is read and decoded on a
//!   worker thread the first time it is asked for ([`FileState`]); the request waits for
//!   it ([`Waiting`]) and starts once it is ready, with the listener as it is then; a
//!   game event's one-shot whose file comes in more than [`MAX_ONE_SHOT_WAIT`] after it
//!   was asked for is dropped instead. A
//!   folder's files come from an index of the folders the SOUN records name, listed on
//!   a worker at the start; a request for a folder before it is in waits for it. Before, the first playing of a file read and decoded it in
//!   the frame (9-15 ms in the slow frames of the profiling campaign's exterior runs).
//!   What the original game does with a sound whose file is not in memory yet is not
//!   known. The exit report counts the requests that began at once and those that waited.
//! - **A second chance in the frame** (#1428) [engineering choice]: late in the frame,
//!   before the audio output takes up new players ([`late_start`], `PostUpdate`), the
//!   decodes finished since [`play`] are taken in once more and the requests whose file
//!   is now ready start as [`play`] starts them, so a file decoded a few milliseconds
//!   after it was asked for can start in that frame. The exit report counts them apart.
//! - **Loudness**: the static attenuation is taken off (gain 10^(−dB ÷ 20)). A sound with
//!   a place follows its record's attenuation curve [documented: GECK wiki Sound,
//!   Attenuation tab: five sliders, "the sound's volume percentage at its inner radius"
//!   down to "at its outer radius", the curve between, "logarithmic" by default]: the
//!   first point within its minimum distance of the listener (the player's eye), the last
//!   at its maximum distance, silent beyond ([`distance_gain`]). The three middle points
//!   stand evenly between the two distances and the volume goes straight from point to
//!   point ([`curve_gain`]) [hypothesis]; a percentage is a share of the amplitude
//!   [hypothesis]. A record without a curve plays the default 100, 50, 20, 5, 0.
//! - **Panning** [design; how the game places sounds is not known]: a sound with a place
//!   is heard more on the side of the listener it is on ([`pan_gains`]): the ear facing
//!   it hears it whole, the other ear loses up to [`PAN_DEPTH`] of it, by how far to the
//!   side it is (straight ahead, behind, above or below: both ears alike). A panned sound
//!   is played in stereo, its channels mixed to one first. The listener is the player's
//!   eye, facing the player's heading; [`pan_sounds`] follows the listener while a sound
//!   plays ([`SoundAt`]). Sounds at the listener (the player's own, interface sounds)
//!   and the background loops are not panned. Other modules' positioned streams use
//!   [`Panned`] (placed loops in [`crate::ambient`], radios in [`crate::radio`]).
//! - **Pitch**: the frequency adjustment, and ±5% at random with the Random Frequency
//!   Shift flag [design: the size of the shift].
//! - **Loops.** A [`LoopSound`] starts a SOUN going round and stops it again (a
//!   weapon's Shoot 3D Looping sound while it fires).
//! - **Things that sound while they are there** ([`SoundSource`]): a creature's conscious
//!   loop, an activator's or a container's looping sound; sent every frame they should
//!   sound and played by [`crate::ambient`] as it plays sound markers.
//! - **Reverb** ([`crate::reverb`]): a world sound plays through the reverb environment
//!   of the listener's acoustic space as it starts, in stereo, with a tail after its file.
//! - The sounds animations and doors name in their text keys
//!   (reloads, footsteps, armour rustle, doors) are sent here by nvforever's
//!   `anim_sounds.rs` (docs/spec-notes/audio.md §10). Placed sounds and the cells'
//!   background loops are [`crate::ambient`]; music is [`crate::music`].
//!
//! [`SfxSettings`] turns them off (`nvforever --no-sound`) and sets the volume.
