//! Reputation in play (docs/spec-notes/reputation.md; owner's playtest list 5, item 13):
//! the rules are the game's (`fnv_game::functions::reputation`); this module shows what
//! came of them.
//!
//! - **The box**: when a reputation's title changes (its fame or infamy reaches another
//!   level, from a script's AddReputation or a crime, `crate::crime`) the game opens a
//!   message box for it: the reputation's name as the title, the new title and its
//!   description, a Vault Boy face at the left and "Ok" [observed: the owner's two
//!   screenshots in C:\fnv-private\Faction Reputation, "Goodsprings / Liked" and "Powder
//!   Gangers / Vilified"]. It waits in the game's queue of boxes (`Game::show_box` with
//!   the REPU's FormID), so it stops the game as a message box does; `crate::script_hud`
//!   draws it with [`panel`].
//! - **Sound**: `UIRepGood` when fame reached a new level, else `UIRepBad` [observed: the
//!   two SOUN records in FalloutNV.esm; hypothesis: when each plays].
//! - **Log**: `reputation:` lines for each change of title.
//! - **Not in a fight**: while the player is in combat the box, sound and log line wait,
//!   and come when the fight is over (a title that changed back meanwhile shows nothing)
//!   [owner request 2026-10-19]. In combat is the wait menu's test (`crate::wait`): a
//!   drawn, living actor in a combat state hunts the player, as IsInCombat reads it.
//! - A save keeps the titles last shown, so a load shows no box for what it restores.
