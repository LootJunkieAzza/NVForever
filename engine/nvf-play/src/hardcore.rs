//! Hardcore mode as a switch of the settings page's Gameplay group (kept in
//! `NVForever.ini` as every row is) [owner 2026-10-25]. The rules are `fnv_game::needs`'s
//! (`Game::set_hardcore`: turning it off clears the needs and their stages' effects);
//! this keeps the switch and the running game agreeing each frame:
//!
//! - A flip of the switch is handed to the game (SetHardcore).
//! - The game changing it itself (a script's or the console's SetHardcore, a loaded save
//!   that has it set) moves the switch, so the page shows what the game plays by.
//! - A new game that never set it plays by the switch.
