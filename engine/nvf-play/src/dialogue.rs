//! The dialogue screen (docs/design/dialogue.md step D4; keys, states, the test aid and
//! the checks: docs/design/dialogue-play.md). The conversation itself is the runtime's
//! (`fnv_game::dialogue`, docs/spec-notes/dialogue.md §4–§6): this file shows
//! `Game::dialogue` and turns keys and clicks into `Game::choose`, `Game::skip_response`
//! and `Game::end_dialogue`. The menu is drawn as the original's by
//! `crate::dialogue_menu` (docs/spec-notes/dialogue-menu.md).
//!
//! - **Start.** E on an actor whose default action is to talk starts a conversation with
//!   its greeting (`script::Runtime::talk_after`); so does a script's `Activate player`
//!   on an actor, and scripts start conversations themselves with StartConversation. An
//!   actor with nothing to say starts none (the line "… has nothing to say" and a log
//!   line). Nor does an actor whose greeting has the Goodbye flag when the player talks
//!   to it: it says the line at the player (a subtitle and its voice, like a SayTo line)
//!   and the player is not held [owner statement 2026-10-10; the runtime's rule,
//!   `Game::start_dialogue`]. When the actor force-greets (StartConversation, a Dialogue
//!   package) it is a conversation of that one line, which holds the player until it is
//!   said [owner statement 2026-10-11; `Game::force_greet`].
//! - **State and pausing** (docs/design/dialogue.md, Pausing). While a conversation runs
//!   the game is in [`PlayState::Dialogue`]. Game logic stands still as in the container
//!   and inventory menus and under a script's message box: the player cannot move or
//!   act, and the player's character, the physics world, the game clock, combat and
//!   travelling NPCs ([`WorldHeld`]) hold; scripts are in menu mode by the runtime's own
//!   rule (`Game::in_menu`: MenuMode blocks with code 1009, game time and quest delays
//!   stand still) [owner ruling 2026-10-10: a conversation with the player pauses the
//!   game; lines said outside one, SayTo and Say, do not]. The actor's lines go on in
//!   real time (`Game::tick` advances them in menu mode too).
//!   What the picture does is the switch for every menu, [`MenuPause`] (`--menu-pause`,
//!   `crate::pause`): `living` (the default) keeps everything that is only presentation
//!   running (animations, wind, water, sky, effects) and lets the player look around
//!   with the mouse while the actor speaks ([`FreeLook`]; the cursor comes back when
//!   choices are offered [owner decision 2026-10-10]); `original` stops the virtual
//!   clock, so the picture stands still, with the cursor free throughout [owner
//!   preference 2026-10-10 for `living`: a deliberate departure from the original's look
//!   that keeps what scripts see]. A message box a result script shows holds the
//!   conversation until it is answered (the runtime's rule); Esc opens the pause menu,
//!   which holds everything, the actor's voice included.
//! - **The actor speaks.** The response being said is shown on a dark band, the actor's
//!   name at the top right (`crate::dialogue_menu`); the log's `subtitle:` line has it as
//!   "Speaker: text" ([`subtitle`]). Space, Enter, Activate (E) or a click skip to the
//!   next response (`Game::skip_response`).
//! - **The player chooses.** The offered choices are listed between two brackets: 1–9
//!   pick one by its place, Up / Down (W / S, the mouse wheel) move the selection, Enter,
//!   Space or Activate pick the selected one, a click picks the one under the cursor. A
//!   choice the actor has answered before is dimmed (`Choice::darkened`); a skill or perk
//!   line carries its tag, and the frame of one the player falls short of is red.
//! - **Leaving.** Tab says goodbye: it picks the offered Goodbye choice, so the actor
//!   says its goodbye line and the conversation ends as the data ends it. Without such a
//!   choice Tab is refused (a forced conversation; a log line says so).
//!
//! Debug switch `NVF_PLAY_DEBUG_TALK_BREAK=1` (off unless set; a development tool, not
//! for a release [owner decision 2026-10-10]): Shift+Tab breaks the conversation off at
//! any point (`Game::end_dialogue`: the line being said is cut, no end script runs, so a
//! quest result can be lost). Without the switch Shift+Tab does nothing.
//!
//! Test aid `NVF_PLAY_TEST_TALK=<when>:<who>[=<step>|<step>…][;…]` ([`parse_talks`]):
//! - `<when>`: seconds after the start, or `<seconds>@<quest>=<stage>` (after that stage
//!   was first seen done), as in `NVF_PLAY_TEST_SCRIPT`;
//! - `<who>`: a reference (Editor ID, hex FormID, `placed:<base>`) the player activates
//!   then, wherever the crosshair is; or `*`: nothing is started, the steps answer the
//!   next conversation that a script starts;
//! - steps, each once the actor has finished speaking: `<n>` picks the n-th offered
//!   choice (0-based, as `fnvtool dialogue talk`'s `index`), a topic's Editor ID or hex
//!   FormID picks that topic, any other text picks the choice that reads so (ignoring
//!   case; a part of it if only one choice contains it; quotes force text), `leave`
//!   leaves as Tab does, `skip` skips the response being said, and `break` presses
//!   Shift+Tab (which does something only with the debug switch).
//!
//! `NVF_PLAY_TEST_TALK_DELAY=<seconds>` (default [`AID_CHOOSE_SECONDS`]) is how long the
//! choices stay on screen before a step picks one (for screenshots).
//!
//! When the steps run out the aid leaves: by the Goodbye choice if one is offered, else
//! by breaking off. **Unattended runs never wait for input**: a conversation no script
//! answers is left the same way after [`UNATTENDED_CHOOSE_SECONDS`] of choosing, and
//! any conversation after [`UNATTENDED_TALK_LIMIT`].
//!
//! Log, one line each (`dialogue: …`, [`log_event`]): a conversation started, every
//! response said (speaker, topic, line, text), the choices offered, the choice made, a
//! topic added, the conversation ended (reason, lines). The trace log
//! (`NVF_PLAY_SCRIPT_TRACE`) has the same as trace events, and a `talk_input` line for
//! each thing the player or the aid did.
