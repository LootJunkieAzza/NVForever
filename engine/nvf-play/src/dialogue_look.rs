//! The player's view in a conversation (dialogue step D7, docs/design/dialogue-play.md
//! §8): while the dialogue screen is open the player's view turns to the face of the
//! actor they talk to. The actor's side (its head and body turning to the player) is the
//! renderer's (`engine/nvforever/src/dialogue_look.rs`), which also says where the face
//! is ([`SpeakerFace`]).
//!
//! Only conversations (`Game::dialogue`: E on an actor, a script's StartConversation).
//! A line an actor just says (SayTo, Say) sets no conversation and turns nobody [owner
//! request 2026-10-10].
//!
//! - **Opening.** When a conversation starts the view eases onto the actor's face over
//!   [`OPEN_SECONDS`] ([`smooth`], no snap).
//! - **Free look stays** [owner decision 2026-10-10, `crate::dialogue::FreeLook`]: while
//!   the actor speaks the mouse looks around as before. An ease never fights it: if
//!   anything else moved the view since the ease last wrote it (the mouse, a test aid),
//!   the ease is dropped ([`Ease::step`]).
//! - **Choices.** When the choices appear (the cursor is released and the view holds) the
//!   view eases back onto the face over [`RECENTRE_SECONDS`], unless
//!   [`LookSettings::recentre_on_choices`] is off (`nvforever --no-dialogue-recentre`)
//!   [the coordinator's reading of the owner's two requests together, 2026-10-10; to be
//!   confirmed by the owner].
//! - **No roll, no zoom.** Only the view's heading and pitch change (`Player::heading`,
//!   `Player::pitch`); the camera's field of view and place are left alone. A dialogue
//!   camera is not built (dialogue-play.md §8.5).
//! - **Pausing** (docs/design/dialogue.md §8). The eases run on the virtual clock, so the
//!   Esc pause menu holds them. With `--menu-pause original` the picture stands still
//!   for the whole conversation (the virtual clock is paused), so an ease is completed at
//!   once: the frozen picture shows the two facing each other.
//!
//! All angles and timings here are NVForever's design choices, not the original's values.
//!
//! Log, one line each, starting `dialogue look:`: the view starts turning (to whom, from
//! and to which angles), an ease dropped because the view was moved, the re-centring on
//! choices, and the end of the conversation.
