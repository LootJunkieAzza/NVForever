//! The player's view in a conversation (dialogue step D7, docs/design/dialogue-play.md
//! §8): while the dialogue screen is open the player's view turns to the face of the
//! actor they talk to. The actor's side (its head and body turning to the player) is the
//! renderer's (`engine/nvforever/src/dialogue_look.rs`), which also says where the face
//! is ([`SpeakerFace`]).
//!
//! Only conversations (`Game::dialogue`: E on an actor, a script's StartConversation).
//! A line an actor just says (SayTo, Say) sets no conversation and does not turn the
//! view [owner request 2026-10-10]; one said to someone turns the speaker (the engine's
//! `speech_look.rs`, dialogue-play.md §9).
//!
//! - **Opening.** When a conversation starts the view eases onto the actor's face over
//!   [`OPEN_SECONDS`] ([`smooth`], no snap).
//! - **Zoom locks, free look does not zoom** [owner decision 2026-11-13, #2254: "want it
//!   split so free look camera does not zoom and when zoom lock the camera"]: while the
//!   conversation is zoomed ([`view_locked`]) the view follows the face for the whole
//!   conversation and the mouse moves only the cursor ([`Ease::follow`]). Without the
//!   zoom only the opening turn happens and the mouse looks around as before; an ease
//!   never fights it [owner decision 2026-10-10, `crate::dialogue::FreeLook`;
//!   `Ease::step`].
//! - **Choices without the zoom.** The view does not come back by itself: after the
//!   opening turn it is the player's own for the rest of the conversation [owner decision
//!   2026-10-10: "never come back i just want the initial look at npc to happen then
//!   allow the player to free look the rest of the time"]. With
//!   [`LookSettings::recentre_on_choices`] on (`nvforever --dialogue-recentre`) the view
//!   eases back onto the face over [`RECENTRE_SECONDS`] each time the choices appear.
//! - **No roll.** Only the view's heading and pitch change here (`Player::heading`,
//!   `Player::pitch`). The zoom is `crate::dialogue_zoom`'s (the field of view and, from
//!   third person, the camera's place, dialogue-play.md §8.8); with it the turn aims a
//!   little under the face ([`crate::dialogue_zoom::face_drop`]), so the face sits above
//!   the view's centre [design: `Ease::follow`].
//! - **Pausing** (docs/design/dialogue.md §8). The eases run on the virtual clock, so the
//!   Esc pause menu holds them. With `--menu-pause original` the picture stands still
//!   for the whole conversation (the virtual clock is paused), so an ease is completed at
//!   once: the frozen picture shows the two facing each other.
//!
//! All angles and timings here are NVForever's design choices, not the original's values.
//!
//! Log, one line each, starting `dialogue look:`: the view starts turning (to whom, from
//! and to which angles), an ease dropped because the view was moved, the re-centring on
//! choices, and the end of the conversation.
