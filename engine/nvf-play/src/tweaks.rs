//! The settings page's Tweaks tab (docs/design/tweaks.md): optional changes to how the
//! game plays or what it shows, each off (or at "no change") unless the player sets it.
//! The list follows the features of Stewie's Tweaks, a script-extender plugin for the
//! original, each written here from what the plugin's readme says it does; neither its
//! code nor its files are used, and the labels and notes are NVForever's own words. A
//! row's note names the plugin's INI key it stands for, so a player who knows the plugin
//! can find theirs. Rows are kept in `NVForever.ini` `[Settings]` as every row is
//! (`crate::settings`), under keys starting `tweak-`.
//!
//! The values live in [`TweakSettings`]: the game's rules' part (`fnv_game::tweaks`) is
//! handed to the running game each frame ([`sync`], as the difficulty is: the game is
//! made after the settings are read, and again for a loaded save); the engine's own
//! modules read the rest from the resource.
