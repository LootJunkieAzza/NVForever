//! Controller aim assist (docs/design/controller.md §5, combat.md §5.1): with a controller
//! working the controls, the right stick turns slower while the crosshair is on a nearby
//! hostile (#1196), and aiming down the sights eases the view onto one near the crosshair
//! for a moment (#1197). The mouse never gets either. All of it is [design]: the original
//! only bends shots toward a target near the crosshair (its auto aim, `fAutoAim*`), it
//! does not touch the view [documented: GECK wiki "Auto Aim Settings", owner's export].
//!
//! - **The target** ([`pick`]): a living actor drawn now (`crate::hitvol::HitVolumes`)
//!   that is hostile to the player (fighting the player, or would attack it: the rule the
//!   crosshair's red uses, `crate::hud_target`), within `fAutoAimMaxDistance` (1800) of
//!   the crosshair ray's start, inside the on-target cone around the crosshair
//!   ([`cone_half_angle`], from `fAutoAimScreenPercentage`, 10), and seen along a ray to
//!   its aim point (the same collision world shots use, passing what shots pass: water,
//!   triggers and NPCs' walking capsules, [`sight_filter`]; no lock through walls). The
//!   nearest to the crosshair by angle wins. Its aim point is the middle of its torso's
//!   posed part, else [`TORSO_ABOVE_FEET`] over its feet.
//! - **Slowdown** ([`slow_target`], [`ease`]): while the crosshair is within the
//!   target's body ([`FRICTION_RADIUS`] around the aim point, seen from the crosshair),
//!   the stick's turn is scaled down by the Aim slowdown setting, at most
//!   [`MAX_SLOWDOWN`]; the scale eases in and out over [`EASE_SECS`], so the turn never
//!   jumps. Friction only, no pull.
//! - **Lock-on** ([`Lock`], [`pull_step`]): when aiming down the sights begins (Block,
//!   LT, with the weapon out) and a target is picked, the view turns toward its aim point
//!   for [`LOCK_SECS`], easing in with a time constant [`PULL_TAU`] over the strength and
//!   at most [`MAX_PULL_RATE`] × strength radians a second, following a moving target. It
//!   lets go at the end, when the target dies, leaves the cone ([`HOLD_CONE`] of it),
//!   range or sight, when aiming ends, or when the right stick is pushed hard against the
//!   pull ([`breaks_lock`]). A new lock needs [`LOCK_COOLDOWN`] since the last began, so
//!   tapping LT does not aim for the player.
//! - **Not while** the free camera, the weapon wheel, a kill camera, VATS mode, an
//!   animation driving the view, furniture holding the player, a script's look lock, a
//!   circling or detached camera, an ungrabbed cursor or anything but play has the look
//!   (the guards of `crate::player`'s look, and VATS: [`Guards`]).
//! - **Settings** (Controller group of the settings page, kept in `[Settings]` of
//!   NVForever.ini): `aim-assist` on/off (on), `aim-slowdown` and `aim-lock` strengths
//!   (0 turns that part off).
