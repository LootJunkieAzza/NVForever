//! Sounds of the menus the engine draws (docs/spec-notes/audio.md §12): the inventory,
//! container and barter menus, the dialogue menu's choices, the Wait and Sleep menu and
//! the pause menu with its settings page.
//!
//! - **What the interface files say** [observed: `clicksound` and `mouseoversound` in the
//!   base archive's `menus\*.xml`, audio.md §12.1]: a control names the Editor ID of a SOUN
//!   to play when it is clicked and when the pointer comes onto it [documented: GECK wiki
//!   Mouseoversound, Clicksound]. The list rows of the container, barter, dialogue and
//!   pause menus include `list_box_template.xml`: `UIMenuOK` on a click, `UIMenuFocus`
//!   when the pointer comes on; the dialogue menu's topics silence the click
//!   (`&nosound;`), the inventory's list silences both. The settings' switches and meters
//!   click `UIMenuPrevNext`, their back button `UIMenuCancel`.
//! - **What the files do not say** (opening and closing a menu, taking everything, a
//!   trade, the Wait menu's slider and buttons) is chosen by the SOUN records' names and
//!   tagged so in [`sound_for`] and audio.md §12.2.
//! - **How it is wired.** The menus' own state is watched here where it says enough:
//!   [`crate::menu::ActiveMenu`] (a menu opened or closed), [`crate::wait::WaitMenu`]
//!   (opened, slider, accept, cancel, done), [`crate::dialogue_menu::DialogueMenu`] (the
//!   selected choice, a choice answered) and the pause menu's page. What only the menu
//!   knows (a command's outcome: a row put up for barter, an item put on or used, take
//!   all, a trade or a refusal, a settings switch flipped) it sends as [`UiSound`];
//!   [`menu_event`] tells the inventory, container and barter menus' commands apart.
//! - Items moved in a container keep the item's own pick-up and drop sounds
//!   (`crate::world_sounds`); for Take All they are held back and `UIItemTakeAll` plays
//!   once. An aid item used from the inventory plays its record's consume sound (ALCH
//!   `ENIT` Sound - Consume [documented: xEdit, `schemas/fnv/objects.json`]).
//! - Played at the listener (`PlaySound { at: None }`). Message boxes (`world_sounds`) and
//!   the quest lines (`quest_messages`) play their own.
//!
//! A `ui sounds summary` line at the end.
