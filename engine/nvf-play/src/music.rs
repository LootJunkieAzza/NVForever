//! Music in the game (docs/spec-notes/audio.md §4, §13): the music of the place the
//! player is in, battle music, incidental phrases and the music scripts ask for.
//!
//! - **Where.** Audio markers (references with `MMRK` data) give places a radius and a
//!   media location controller (ALOC), which names media sets (MSET). The marker the
//!   player is deepest inside chooses (`fnv_world::audio::marker_at`); its controller's
//!   set is picked on entering it, at random among the list heard: with a conditional
//!   faction, the list for the faction's standing towards the player
//!   (`MediaController::sets_for`, GetFactionRelation's rule), else its location sets.
//!   A change of standing picks again.
//! - **Layers.** A location set has three tracks for the day and three for the night,
//!   files of one length under `music\`. All three play together from the start, mixed
//!   in one source so they stay in step ([`LayeredMusic`]); the outer one sounds
//!   anywhere inside the marker's radius and the middle and inner ones are faded in as
//!   the player comes nearer the marker (`fnv_world::audio::layers`) [hypothesis: the
//!   layers add up]. A layer fades over the set's layer crossfade time, and so does a
//!   change of set or between day and night [design]. A layer that came in stays at
//!   least the set's minimum time on [hypothesis: GECK wiki "Minimum Time on Layer"].
//! - **Dungeon sets** in a controller's lists play their explore track, add the suspense
//!   track while a hostile actor near has noticed the player and the battle track in a
//!   battle [hypothesis: the GECK wiki's descriptions; the three files are stems of one
//!   length like a location set's].
//! - **Battle** ([`MusicCues`]): a living hostile actor (`fnv_game::rest::hostile_to_player`)
//!   within `fCombatMusicNearCombatOuterRadius` that has the player detected
//!   [hypothesis; NVForever's actors do not fight on their own yet, design]. A battle
//!   set from the marker's controller's battle list, else from the region the cell's
//!   acoustic space or the cell names, picked at random; its intro sound after its wait
//!   time, its loop then, faded in and out over its loop fade-out time; the battle ends
//!   `fCombatMusicStopTime` seconds after the last threat, its outro sound plays, and
//!   the place's music comes back after the set's recovery time [documented: GECK wiki
//!   Media Set field descriptions, "unverified" there].
//! - **Incidental phrases**: where no music plays, the region's incidental set plays its
//!   day or night sound after a random wait between its two times [hypothesis: minutes,
//!   see audio.md §13.4].
//! - **Scripts** (`PlayMusic`, `fnv_game::sound`): the music type plays beside the
//!   place's music [documented: GECK wiki PlayMusic, "will not stop the currently playing
//!   music of a music marker"], once or looping by its `ANAM` sign; a type without a file
//!   (`1NoMusic`) stops it [hypothesis].
//! - **Cells and worldspaces** name a music type (MUSC); it plays when no marker reaches
//!   the player and its file exists [design]. The base game's cells name types whose
//!   folders it does not ship, so nothing is heard from them [observed].
//! - **Files** are MP3, decoded by rodio (symphonia) as they play; a set loops by
//!   starting its files again. Intro, outro and incidental sounds are SOUN records,
//!   played by `crate::sfx` at the listener.
//! - **The player's death** ([`MusicCues::dead`]): what plays fades out, a battle ends
//!   without its outro, and the SOUN `MUSDeath` plays once at the listener (FalloutNV.esm
//!   0x00078595, `fx\mus\mus_death.wav`, flagged 2D; the archives hold it as `.ogg`)
//!   [observed: the record and its file; hypothesis: that the death plays it, by its
//!   name]. No music plays while the player is dead; alive again, the place's music
//!   comes back [design].
//! - Music goes on in menus and behind loading screens [design].
//! - Not built: the main menu's music (no main menu yet; `SMainMenuMusicTrack`), the
//!   controllers' retrigger delay and `NAM1` (not understood), `IsMusicPlaying`-style
//!   queries.
//!
//! [`MusicSettings`] turns it off (`nvforever --no-music`) and sets the volume
//! (`--music-volume`). One log line per set started, per change of layers, per battle,
//! per script request and per incidental phrase; a `music summary` line at the end.
