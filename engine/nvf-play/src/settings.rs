//! The switches of the pause menu's settings page (`crate::pause` draws it): the on/off
//! choices of the command line that can change while the game runs, e.g. whether a
//! conversation freezes the picture (`--menu-pause`). Not the original's settings menu:
//! neither its entries nor its layout are copied.
//!
//! A [`Setting`] reads and writes the state the game itself uses (a resource of the
//! module that owns the switch), so the page keeps no copy of its own: a switch starts
//! as the command line left it and a flip acts at once. The module that owns a switch
//! registers it ([`add_setting`]): nvf-play its own in its plugins, nvforever the
//! renderer's after adding [`crate::PlayPlugin`].
//!
//! Every switch is kept in `[Settings]` of the home's `NVForever.ini`
//! (`fnv_install::EngineHome::config_file`, beside the game folder's `[Game]`), one
//! `key=1` or `key=0` line each: a flip writes all of them, and the next start (also the
//! restart that loads a save) sets each listed switch to its stored value once every
//! switch is registered ([`apply_stored`], `PostStartup`), so the INI wins over the
//! command line. A key not in the file keeps the command line's state; a value other
//! than 1/0 (true/false, on/off, yes/no) is skipped with a warning. Unattended runs (test
//! aids) leave the INI of the player's home alone, neither read nor written; with
//! `NVFOREVER_HOME` set they use that home's INI, so a test can check the round trip.
//!
//! A row whose note names a command-line switch (`--msaa`, `--no-lip`; not one it is "a
//! part of") counts as set by the command line when that switch was given
//! ([`GivenSwitches`], filled by the program from its command line). When the INI holds
//! another state for such a row, the log says so (#1382): in a test run (a timed or
//! measured run, [`GivenSwitches::win`]) the command line's state is kept and the stored
//! one is not applied, so a measurement or a smoke run tests what its switches say;
//! otherwise the stored state is applied as before, with a warning naming the switch it
//! overrode.
//!
//! A row can be a [`Slider`] instead ([`Setting::slider`]): a part of a full amount, up
//! to 1, set in steps by Left/Right or its meter (e.g. how far objects are drawn, as a
//! part of how far they are drawn at most). It is kept as `key=0.50`; a value that is not
//! a number is skipped with a warning, one out of range is brought into it. A slider can
//! show its value as words instead of a percentage ([`Slider::shown`]): a choice among a
//! few (the anti-aliasing, [`Slider::choice`]) or a number of its own (the field of
//! view's degrees), still kept as the part.
//!
//! A row can be a list of choices instead, shown as a dropdown ([`ChoiceList`],
//! [`add_choice_list`]): the choices are named (e.g. the resolutions of the window's
//! monitor) and may differ from run to run, so it is kept by its own text (e.g.
//! `resolution=1600x900;desktop`), not as a number. A list that asks to be kept (the
//! resolution) takes a choice for a while only ([`KEEP_SECS`]): the page asks whether to
//! keep it, and unless it is kept by then it goes back to the one before
//! ([`PendingKeep`]); until it is kept, the INI keeps the one before.
//!
//! A list may show its choices by other words than their names ([`set_choice_labels`]) and
//! hold some of them out of reach for a reason ([`set_choice_unavailable`]) [design:
//! docs/design/dlss-upscaling.md]. The names stay what the INI, the log and the test aids
//! use; the words are only what the page draws. A choice out of reach is drawn dim and
//! cannot be taken from the page or by a test aid ([`pick`] refuses it with a log line),
//! but the INI's text still loads it ([`apply_stored`]): a stored request survives a run in
//! which it cannot be met.
//!
//! A list that took over from an older row can read that row's INI key when its own is not in
//! the file ([`set_older_key`]; its `load` takes the older row's text), and the test aids can
//! still name the older row ([`set_list_alias`], [`pick_alias`]): nvforever's `fsr-upscaling`,
//! now its Upscaler and Upscaling mode rows. Where the older row's one value stands for
//! several rows, it is split into each row's own value before the INI is read
//! ([`set_older_split`], [`with_older_split`]), so each row loads it, and a test run keeps
//! ([`KeptRows`]) and later writes, a value of its own.
//!
//! What is not here: choices fixed when the game starts (which NPCs live by their
//! packages, FaceGen, the load order), most numbers (the volumes, the field of view and the
//! draw distances are sliders) and the test aids.
