//! Dialogue voice in the game (docs/design/dialogue.md step D3, docs/spec-notes/voice.md):
//! the lines scripts make actors say (`Game::speech`, today SayTo and Say) are heard, and
//! last as long as their sound.
//!
//! - **Index.** `fnv_voice::VoiceBank` (the lines of the load order over the archives) is
//!   built on its own thread at the start, like the script data. Once both are ready the
//!   bank becomes the runtime's line-length hook (`Game::voice`): a response lasts as
//!   long as its voice file, and keeps the length fitted to its text when it has none.
//!   A line started before that keeps the length it started with.
//! - **Playback.** Each frame the lines being said (`Game::speech`, and the line of a
//!   conversation with the player, `Game::dialogue`) are compared with what is playing:
//!   a response that starts gets its file read from the archive and played through
//!   Bevy's audio (`AudioPlayer`, Ogg Vorbis by the `vorbis` feature; the 40 lines that
//!   also exist as WAV play their Ogg file); a line that stops before its sound is over
//!   (cut by another line, or its speaker gone) has the sound stopped. One log line per
//!   sound started: `voice: playing <path> (<seconds> s) ...`; a response without a file
//!   logs `voice: no file ...`.
//! - **Held with its line.** Whatever holds a line's timer holds its sound
//!   ([`line_held`]): a SayTo or Say line stands still in menu mode (the inventory, a
//!   container, a message box, a conversation with the player), so its sound is paused
//!   there and resumed after; a line of the conversation itself goes on in real time and
//!   is held only by a message box on top of it; the pause menu holds every line. One log
//!   line each way (`voice: … held` / `goes on`).
//! - **Heard where it is said** (since 2026-10-11, owner request: "audio volume based on
//!   the distance … if the NPC is out of hearing range we shouldn't show the
//!   subtitle"). A line said outside the conversation with the player (SayTo, Say, a
//!   hello, a line between two actors, a detection bark) is heard from where its
//!   speaker stands ([`hearing`]): at full volume within [`DIALOG_MIN_DISTANCE`] of the
//!   player's eye, falling as minimum ÷ distance beyond it and fading to nothing at
//!   [`DIALOG_MAX_DISTANCE`] ([`voice_gain`], the shape `crate::sfx` gives sound effects),
//!   and panned to the side it is on (`crate::sfx::pan_gains`), following the speaker and
//!   the player while it plays. A speaker in another cell (an interior other than the
//!   player's, or inside while the player is outside) is not heard. While a line is not
//!   heard it is silent and shows no subtitle (`crate::script_hud`; [`audible`]): both
//!   follow the distance while the line lasts; the log says `voice: … out of hearing`
//!   when a response starts out of hearing. The
//!   conversation with the player stays at full volume and unpanned. Lip sync follows
//!   [`VoiceState::spoken`] from `nvforever`'s `lips.rs` (docs/spec-notes/lipsync.md).
//!
//! Switches: [`VoiceSettings`] (`nvforever --no-voice`, `--voice-volume`);
//! `NVF_PLAY_VOICE_LENGTHS=0` keeps the fitted line lengths (sounds still play).
