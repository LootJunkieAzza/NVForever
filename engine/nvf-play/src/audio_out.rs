//! The sound output: NVForever's stand-in for Bevy's `AudioPlugin` output, so sound
//! follows the audio device (engine behaviour, not a parity target: the original game's
//! behaviour on a device change is not documented here).
//!
//! **Why not Bevy's.** `bevy_audio` 0.19 opens the default device once at startup
//! (`AudioOutput`, `DeviceSinkBuilder::open_default_sink`) and keeps it for the whole run;
//! the resource is crate-private, so nothing outside can reopen it, and if no device
//! exists at startup the run stays silent [observed: bevy_audio-0.19.1
//! src/audio_output.rs]. cpal 0.17's WASAPI stream does not follow the default device
//! either: `default_output_device` resolves the endpoint once
//! (`GetDefaultAudioEndpoint`), the stream's client is activated on that endpoint, no
//! `IMMNotificationClient` is registered, and when the endpoint goes away the render
//! loop reports `DeviceNotAvailable` (`AUDCLNT_E_DEVICE_INVALIDATED`) to the error
//! callback and stops [observed: cpal-0.17.3 src/host/wasapi/device.rs `default_device`,
//! stream.rs `process_output`]. So after Windows switches the default output the sound
//! stays on the old device, and after an unplug it goes silent [hypothesis for the
//! unplug: read from the source, not watched on every driver].
//!
//! **How it works.**
//! - Every sound plays into one mixer that lives for the whole run ([`AudioOut::mixer`],
//!   48 kHz stereo; rodio converts each sound to it and the device's mixer converts it
//!   to the device). The device only taps that mixer, so dropping a device and opening
//!   another loses nothing: music, loops, radio, voice and one-shots carry on from where
//!   they were, the components (`AudioPlayer`, `AudioSink`, `PlaybackSettings`) are
//!   Bevy's own, and the call sites only swap `bevy::audio::AddAudioSource` for
//!   [`AddAudioSource`] here.
//! - A watcher thread owns the device. It reopens on: the stream's error callback
//!   (device gone or the stream invalidated; underruns are ignored), the default output
//!   device's id changing (polled every [`POLL`]: one `GetDefaultAudioEndpoint` call,
//!   cheaper and simpler than a COM `IMMNotificationClient`, works on any cpal host, and
//!   1 s is inside the ~2 s the owner allowed), and the test aid. Opening tries the
//!   default device, then any other output device.
//! - With no device (none at startup, or all unplugged) the watcher drains the mixer at
//!   the real-time rate into nothing, so sounds still end on time (one-shots despawn,
//!   voice lines finish, music moves on), and it tries to open a device every [`POLL`].
//! - **Volumes by category** (owner request 2026-10-17, the original's audio menu:
//!   Master, Music, Footstep, Voice, Effects, Radio [observed: the owner's photo of the
//!   game's settings]). Each [`SoundCategory`] has a mixer of its own that plays into the
//!   run-long one at its volume times the master volume ([`SoundVolumes`]), so a change
//!   reaches the sounds already playing, eased over [`VOLUME_EASE`] so a slider does not
//!   click. A sound's category is the [`SoundCategory`] component of its entity, Effects
//!   without one. Music (the music and the main menu's theme), voice (dialogue lines) and
//!   radio tag their sounds; effects whose SOUN editor ID starts with `FST` (footsteps,
//!   jumps, landings, armour steps) are Footstep [hypothesis: which sounds the original
//!   counts as footsteps; the names are docs/spec-notes/audio.md §10]; everything else
//!   (shots, impacts, interface, placed and background sounds, the intro) is Effects
//!   [hypothesis]. A volume scales the samples linearly [hypothesis: the original's curve
//!   is not known; at its default Music 60 its main menu theme plays at 0.61 of the file,
//!   which a linear 0.6 matches; docs/spec-notes/audio.md]. They start at the original's
//!   defaults ([`DEFAULT_VOLUMES`]; issue #1450: all at 1 made music, voices and radio
//!   louder than the original). The settings page's Sound tab sets them
//!   ([`register_settings`]), kept in the INI like every row: an INI written before keeps
//!   its volumes, and the tab's Defaults goes back to these.
//! - **Slowed sound** (owner 2026-10-18: in slow motion sounds should be "more drawn out
//!   and lower pitch like the base game" [observed: the owner's ear, the original's kill
//!   camera and VATS]). [`SoundSpeed`] is the speed the engine's own slow motion (VATS
//!   mode, the death camera) asks sounds to play at; every playing sound of a slowed
//!   category follows it at once, as tape played slower: longer and lower together.
//!   Effects, footsteps and voices slow; music and radio do not, nor interface sounds
//!   ([`KeepsSpeed`]) [hypothesis: what the original leaves at speed]. A script's
//!   SetGlobalTimeMultiplier changes the same sounds by its multiplier unless it asked
//!   for sound unchanged (`script::time_multiplier`).
//! - Spatial `PlaybackSettings` (Bevy's `SpatialAudioSink`) are not built: NVForever pans
//!   its own sounds (`sfx::Panned`); a spatial request plays plain, with a warning.
//! - **The mix bus** ([`MixBus`], #2217) [design]: the run-long mixer on its way to the
//!   device (or to the drain without one) goes through one bus, kept with its state for
//!   the whole run (a reopened device taps the same bus). It measures the summed mix: the
//!   loudest sample and the samples over full scale (`abs(sample) > 1`, each channel
//!   counted apart; exactly ±1 is not over), before and after the output's protection.
//!   The protection is a look-ahead limiter ([`Limiter`]): one gain for both channels of
//!   a frame, no sample out over [`LIMIT_THRESHOLD`] (0.98), turned down in a straight
//!   line within the [`LIMIT_LOOKAHEAD`] (3 ms) before a peak (the deeper the cut, the
//!   earlier it starts) and back up over at most [`LIMIT_RELEASE`]
//!   (50 ms); a mix that stays at or below the threshold passes exactly as it is, 3 ms
//!   later (all sound is 3 ms later for it). Its delay and gain are the bus's, kept
//!   across a device reopen. Each pull measures its block locally and publishes the
//!   totals once; the audio thread takes no other lock and allocates nothing for it.
//!   Whether the original game limits or clips its mix is not known.
//! - **Stopping a playing sound** ([`stop_sound`], #2217) [design]: a sound stopped before
//!   its end (a voice taken over at the voice limit, a loop or a script's sound stopped,
//!   an ambient loop, a radio or a voice line no longer wanted, a holotape stopped, a
//!   film skipped) goes through one call,
//!   which counts why ([`SoundStops`]). Every sound plays through a [`DeclickSource`]
//!   round the whole of it (after its skip, take and repeat), and its entity carries the
//!   [`StopControl`] the source reads: a stop fades the sound out in a straight line over
//!   [`DECLICK_FADE`] (5 ms as heard: the fade is timed by the rate the player plays the
//!   source at, its rate times the sink's speed as rodio's speed stage reports it, slow
//!   motion's and a script's time multiplier included), reverb tail and all, then one frame of silence and
//!   its end for good. Its entity stays, [`Retiring`], until the fade has played out
//!   (a paused one is resumed for it), and [`cleanup_finished`] then removes it whatever
//!   its playback mode. One not attached to the output yet (it has made no sound) or
//!   already over is removed at once, uncounted. A sound's natural end and the fades of
//!   their own (music's layers, the background loops' beds, a script's fade) are not
//!   stops. The stop is the playing's, never the cached sound's (its samples are shared
//!   by every player of the file).
//!
//! Log lines: `audio output: opened <device> (<rate> Hz, <channels> ch)`, `audio output:
//! reopening (<why>)`, `audio output: no device (<why>); sound runs silent until one
//! appears`, and at the end `audio output summary: opened N times, M reopens, X s mixed,
//! Y s since the last open`, then `audio categories: music X s, footstep X s, voice X s,
//! effects X s, radio X s heard; volumes master N%, music N%, …` (the seconds in which a
//! category's mixer had sound, before its volume), then `audio categories after volumes:
//! music X s, … audible` (the same after its volume and the master's: what a slider
//! turned down leaves to be heard; #1077), then `audio mix: pre peak P, N samples over
//! full scale; post peak Q, M samples over full scale; K frames limited` (the mix bus's
//! measurements, peaks to nine decimals: `pre` the summed mix before the limiter, `post`
//! after it, K the stereo frames it played below unity gain). The stop counts are told
//! by `crate::sfx`'s report (`sfx hard stops: …`).
//!
//! Test aid (unattended runs only; no effect unless set):
//! `NVF_PLAY_TEST_AUDIO_REOPEN=<seconds>[,...]` drops the device and opens the default
//! one again at each time, as a switch of device would.
