//! The player on furniture (docs/spec-notes/furniture.md). Activating a piece of
//! furniture asks for it ([`UseFurniture`]); whoever draws the player's body (nvforever's
//! `furniture.rs`) plays the clips and holds the player meanwhile ([`PlayerSeat`]):
//! movement, jumping and the character's collision are off, and pressing a movement
//! control asks to get up [design: how the original game ends sitting is not captured;
//! moving is what its players know], and so does Activate with nothing under the
//! crosshair [design: lying on a bed the furniture itself is out of view].
