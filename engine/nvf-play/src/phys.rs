//! Part P (docs/design/layer4-play.md §4): the physics world around the player — terrain
//! and references' collision streamed by cell, stepped at a fixed rate.
//!
//! Cells follow the player's feet ([`cells`]: 3×3 exterior squares with one square of
//! hysteresis, or the one interior). Reading and building a cell (records, models,
//! rapier shapes: [`prepare`]) happens on the loader thread ([`loader`]); the main thread
//! inserts at most [`CELLS_PER_FRAME`] prepared cells per frame, in the order they were
//! requested, and loads the player's own cell on the spot if it is not in yet (the
//! player never stands in a cell without collision). What a reference contributes is
//! `fnv_phys::ref_collision`, the rule `fnvtool phys cell` uses; whether it is in the
//! world is the simulation's call ([`in_world`]), made when the cell is inserted.
//! `RefChanged` removes or restores one reference's collision; `Travel` rebuilds
//! everything for the destination, which may lie in another worldspace (its own terrain,
//! persistent references and default water height; [`PhysState::worldspace`]). The
//! physics world sets [`Location`] when it applies a `Travel`.
//!
//! References the simulation created (dropped items, `crate::dropped`) load with the
//! physics cell containing them: their base form's model collision, dynamic when the
//! model says so ([`PhysState::add_created`]). While a dynamic one moves, its pose is
//! written back to the simulation ([`PhysState::settle_created`]).
//!
//! Placed references whose collision is one dynamic object (clutter) are written back
//! the same way once physics has moved them (pushed, knocked down: more than
//! [`MOVED_DISTANCE`] or [`MOVED_ROTATION`] from where they were added, so settling on
//! load is not a move): [`PhysState::settle_placed`]. Their cells then build their
//! collision at the simulation's pose (`prepare::Job::poses`), `crate::moved` draws them
//! there, and snapshots keep it. They stay in their placed cell (the cell lists come from
//! the plugins) [engineering choice]. That the game keeps a pushed item where it came to
//! rest is [hypothesis]. Placed clutter is added asleep, so it stays where it was placed
//! until something disturbs it, and a reference with more than one dynamic body (the
//! parts of a jointed object) keeps them keyframed (docs/spec-notes/physics.md §4.3.1;
//! `NVF_PLAY_TEST_PHYS_TRACE`, `phys/trace.rs`, logs what moves after a cell loads).
