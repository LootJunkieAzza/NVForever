//! The player's controls beyond walking and looking, on the game's bindings
//! ([`crate::bindings`]; docs/design/player-body.md §1.2):
//!
//! - Crouch/Sneak (Left Ctrl) toggles sneaking.
//! - Ready Item (R): with the weapon away, draws it; with it out, a tap reloads and a hold
//!   of [`HOLSTER_HOLD`] puts it away [hypothesis: the game's tap/hold split]. Reloading
//!   is `crate::combat`'s. Two taps within [`DOUBLE_TAP`] lower the weapon or raise it
//!   again instead ([`PlayerControl::lowered`]; the owner's request, 2026-10-26), so a
//!   single tap reloads that much later [design].
//! - Use (left mouse) attacks while held ([`PlayerControl::trigger`], `crate::combat`);
//!   with the weapon away it draws it first [hypothesis].
//! - Ammo Swap (hotkey 2) asks `crate::combat` for the next carried ammo type; the
//!   hotkeys 1 to 8 are the weapon wheel's (`crate::weapon_wheel`, which sets
//!   [`PlayerControl::ammo_swap`] on a tap of 2).
//! - Block (right mouse, Left Alt), held: guns aim down the sights, fists and melee
//!   weapons block.
//! - Always Run (Caps Lock) toggles running as the default (on by default:
//!   `bAlwaysRunByDefault=1`); Run (Left Shift) held does the other; Auto Move (Q) walks
//!   forward until Forward or Back is pressed (player.rs).
//! - Toggle POV (F, middle mouse): a tap switches first and third person; held while the
//!   mouse moves, it circles the camera around the player without turning them
//!   ([`Orbit`]; from first person the view goes to third person meanwhile), and when it
//!   is let go the camera swings back behind and the view stays third person [hypothesis:
//!   the game's hold-POV camera; design: the owner 2026-10-19, replacing playtest list 5
//!   item 23's return to first person].
//!   The mouse wheel zooms the third-person camera.
//! - Detached camera (the settings page's Gameplay switch, off by default): in third
//!   person with the weapon away the mouse turns the camera around the player, not the
//!   player, and the player turns to run the way they are pushed, seen from the camera
//!   ([`detach_camera`]) [design: the owner 2026-10-27, "360 movement in third person
//!   with your weapon holstered"; not in the original]. Drawing the weapon turns the
//!   player to where the camera looks.
//! - VATS (V) is VATS mode's (`crate::vats_mode`, docs/design/vats-mode.md), which also
//!   takes Use, Block and Activate while it is on.
//! - Grab (Z) held picks up what is under the crosshair and carries it (`crate::grab`,
//!   docs/spec-notes/grab.md).
//! - Quick Save (F5) and Quick Load (F9) are `crate::save`'s. A control bound but not built
//!   would go in [`NOT_BUILT`], which says so on screen when it is pressed; none is now.
//! - While the weapon wheel holds the input ([`PlayerControl::wheel`]) Use and Block are
//!   not the game's.
//! - Scripts turn groups of controls off and on (`DisablePlayerControls`,
//!   `EnablePlayerControls`): [`ControlLocks`], applied to every frame's requests by
//!   [`enforce_locks`].
//!
//! This module holds the requests; what they look like is the player body's job
//! (nvforever `player_body.rs`), which also writes the eye it sees from into
//! [`crate::player::Player::body_eye`]. The camera ([`place_camera`]) sits at that eye in
//! first person, and behind the shoulder in third person, pulled in where collision is in
//! the way.
