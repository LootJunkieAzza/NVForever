//! Loading screens for travel (doors, scripts moving the player): the game holds still
//! under a full-screen picture until the destination is loaded
//! (docs/design/loading-screen.md; records: docs/spec-notes/loading-screens.md).
//!
//! - Whoever moves the player sends a [`TravelRequest`]. The screen comes up first
//!   ([`PlayState::Loading`]); [`SHOW_FRAMES`] frames later, once it has been drawn, the
//!   request goes on as the [`Travel`] that physics and the renderer apply, so their
//!   work happens behind the picture and not in front of a frozen view of the old place.
//! - While it is up nothing happens in the world: the systems that wait for
//!   `PlayState::Playing` stand still, scripts do not run (`script::run_scripts`), and
//!   Bevy's virtual clock is paused, so everything driven by `Time` (animations, doors,
//!   NPCs, the sky's clock, test aids) holds too. Streaming goes on: it is what is being
//!   waited for.
//! - It comes down when physics has every cell around the player
//!   (`PhysState::loading_done`), the renderer has drawn its cells (it reports through
//!   [`Loading::render_busy`]) and no actor in view still waits for its parts
//!   ([`Loading::actors_busy`]), [`SETTLE_SECS`] later so that textures and meshes reach
//!   the graphics card behind the picture.
//! - A run that starts in the world ([`StartCover`]) is held under the screen from its
//!   first frame until the same is in and the scripts are made (a save put back into
//!   them); the test aids' clock and `--run-seconds` count from when it comes down
//!   (docs/design/loading-screen.md §1a).
//! - The picture and its text are a loading screen record of the plugins
//!   (`fnv_world::loadscreen`): one that belongs to the destination, or one for anywhere.
//!   The layout is ours: the picture fills the window (cropped, not stretched), the text
//!   in a band along the bottom. The original's roulette wheel and progress are not drawn.
//! - A [`CoverRequest`] brings the same screen up with no trip: it holds the game as
//!   above and stays until an [`Uncover`]. nvforever puts it up while loading a save or
//!   going back to the main menu, which start the program again behind it
//!   (nvforever `handoff.rs`); [`Loading::unseen`] is that new run's own start while its
//!   window is still hidden, when streaming may take long frames as behind a screen.
//!   An [`Uncover`] goes back to what the game was in when the cover came: the main
//!   menu or the pause menu, still holding the game, after a load that came to nothing.
//! - A script's EnableLoadingMenu before it moves the player makes that travel's screen
//!   one for anywhere ([`Loading::generic_next`]). The original's few seconds of screen
//!   for the call alone, with no travel, are not built (no shipped call is alone).
//! - While it is up the player's keys, mouse buttons and controller do nothing
//!   ([`hold_input`]): a menu still open behind it (the main menu while a save loads)
//!   takes no clicks, hovers or arrow keys, and a key held through the screen counts
//!   only once it is pressed again.
