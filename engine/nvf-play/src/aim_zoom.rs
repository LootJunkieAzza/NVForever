//! The view zooms in while the player aims down the sights.
//!
//! - **What zooms**: Block held (`PlayerControl::aiming`) with a gun drawn
//!   (`WeaponAnim::ready`) whose WEAP DNAM Sight FOV is above 0 narrows the player
//!   camera's field of view to that Sight FOV [documented: GECK wiki Weapons, Sight FOV is
//!   the field of view down the sights, 0 "essentially disables iron sights";
//!   docs/spec-notes/combat-data.md §1.1]. The zoom is the weapon's own: a lower Sight FOV
//!   zooms in further (the owner's playtest, 2026-10-16: the Varmint Rifle zooms in more
//!   than the Sturdy Caravan Shotgun).
//! - **Units** [hypothesis]: the Sight FOV is read like the FOV setting, the horizontal
//!   angle of a 4:3 view with the vertical angle kept at other aspects
//!   ([`vertical_fov`], docs/spec-notes/camera.md §3).
//! - **Timing** [design]: the field of view moves between the two over [`ZOOM_SECONDS`],
//!   smoothed at both ends; letting go of Block zooms back out at the same pace.
//! - The free camera, menus and melee weapons (which block) do not zoom; both points of
//!   view do. Whatever else sets the field of view (the console's SetCameraFOV,
//!   chargen) sets the unzoomed angle: a change this module did not make is taken as
//!   the new base.
//! - **Scopes** (docs/spec-notes/weapon-scopes.md §2): a scoped gun (WEAP Has Scope, or
//!   Scope from Mod with an Increase Zoom mod on) at full zoom in first person puts its
//!   scope up ([`Scope`]); nvforever `scope_view.rs` draws the MOD3 picture, the night
//!   vision and the sway, the arms rig and the crosshair go meanwhile.
