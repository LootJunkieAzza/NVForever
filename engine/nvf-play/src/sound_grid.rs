//! A coarse grid over fixed places that are heard within a reach of their own, so the
//! per-frame question "which of them can the listener hear" visits only the places that
//! can answer yes: the objects' own sounds (`crate::world_sounds`), the sound markers
//! (`crate::ambient`) and the audio markers (`crate::music`).
//!
//! [design] The grid only narrows the candidates. Every caller still runs its own exact
//! test on each candidate, so the answer is the one a walk over the whole list gives,
//! provided the caller's `far` test (see [`FixedGrid::near`]) can only be true for a
//! bucket none of whose entries the exact test would keep. The candidates come out in
//! list order (ascending index), so a caller that draws random numbers or breaks ties in
//! list order sees the same sequence as the walk over the whole list.
//!
//! Entries are bucketed by exterior cell (`fnv_world::cell_of`) and by the power of two
//! of their reach, so one far-reaching sound does not drag its cell's short-range ones
//! into every query. A bucket keeps the box its entries' places span and the largest
//! reach among them. A query tests the listener against every bucket's box (one per
//! occupied cell and reach class, in one array) and hands out the entries of the buckets
//! in reach. Entries whose place or reach is not a finite number
//! are kept out of the buckets and handed out by every query.
