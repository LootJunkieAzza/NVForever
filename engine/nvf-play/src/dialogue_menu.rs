//! The dialogue menu, drawn as the original draws it (docs/spec-notes/dialogue-menu.md).
//!
//! `crate::dialogue` says what the menu holds ([`DialogueMenu`]: the actor's name, the
//! line being said or the choices offered, the selected choice); this module sets it out
//! by the game's own interface file and draws it with the game's fonts and pictures, read
//! from the owner's archives at run time. Lengths are in the interface's units, 960 to
//! the height of the view.
//!
//! - [`layout`] places everything (pure, tested without the game's files).
//! - While the actor speaks: the line, without a frame, on a dark band. While the player
//!   chooses: the choices between two brackets on the band, the selected one framed, a
//!   scroll bar at the left when not all of them fit.
//! - The actor's name stands at the top right throughout.
//! - While a Goodbye choice is offered, "[Tab] Goodbye" stands at the left of the band,
//!   level with the bottom bracket, in the band's own text on a backing in its shade (list 5
//!   item 62 asked for "TAB) Goodbye" at the left of the dialogue box; the words are now in the
//!   bracket style of the tile menus' key hints, proposed to the maintainer in #1517; the
//!   interface file has no such hint [observed: dialog_menu.xml]): Tab picks that choice
//!   (`crate::dialogue`). The settings page's "Goodbye hint" switch ([`GoodbyeHint`])
//!   hides the words and what is made for them (docs/spec-notes/dialogue-menu.md §4);
//!   Tab works as before.
//! - The menu is rebuilt when what it shows changes; the pointer chooses the choice it
//!   is on (`crate::dialogue` reads the clicks).
