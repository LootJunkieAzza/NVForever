//! The Wait menu, and the same menu as a Sleep menu while the player lies on a bed
//! (docs/spec-notes/wait-menu.md).
//!
//! The Wait control (`Control::Rest`, T by default) opens it while playing. The player
//! picks 1 to 24 hours on the slider and accepts; game time then passes one hour at a
//! time ([`HOUR_SECONDS`] apart) on the one play clock, the simulation's calendar
//! (`fnv_sim::World::advance_hours`: the GameHour, GameDaysPassed and date globals), so
//! the sky, the lighting, the AI packages' clock and scripts read each new hour. The menu
//! counts the hours down meanwhile and closes after the last one; Cancel stops the wait
//! with the hours passed so far.
//!
//! **Sleeping fades the screen out** [owner request 2026-10-11]: once a sleep's hours are
//! accepted the world behind the menu goes to black over [`FADE_SECONDS`] ([`SleepFade`],
//! which whoever draws the world applies), the menu staying on top with its count; when
//! the menu closes the world comes back as fast. A wait does not fade.
//!
//! It is a `PlayState::Menu` like the container and inventory menus: the player, the
//! world and the running game clock stand still, the cursor is free, and the picture
//! follows the menu pause switch (`crate::pause`). To scripts it is menu 1012
//! ([`crate::script::MENU_SLEEP_WAIT`]). It stays shut while a script has the Pip-Boy
//! group of the player's controls off (docs/spec-notes/controls.md §5).
//!
//! Keys: Left / Right (or A / D) and the mouse wheel move the slider one hour, Page Up /
//! Page Down six, Home and End go to its ends, E or Enter accepts, X, Esc or the Wait
//! control cancels; the slider and the two buttons take the mouse (wait-menu.md §6 says
//! which of these are the original's). [`model`] is the menu as plain data.
//!
//! **Refusals** (wait-menu.md §9): instead of opening, a line on the screen says why the
//! player cannot wait or sleep now ([`refusal`]): a script forbade waiting, the player is
//! swimming or in the air, takes radiation damage (an empty check yet), is in combat, has
//! hostile actors near, trespasses, or the bed is someone else's. A script that opens the
//! menu without asking for the check gets it regardless.
//!
//! **Scripts** see a sleep or a wait while its hours pass (`fnv_game::rest`:
//! `IsPCSleeping`, `IsTimePassing`), can open the menu (`ShowSleepWaitMenu`), make the
//! player sleep (`SetPCSleepHours`) and stop a sleep (`WakeUpPC`); [`script_requests`]
//! takes what they asked. A bed's own script is told of the sleep
//! (`Runtime::bed_activated_for_sleep`): that is what gives Well Rested.
//!
//! Test aid `NVF_PLAY_TEST_WAIT=<seconds>:<what>[,…]`: at each time `open` presses the
//! Wait control, `hours=<n>` sets the slider, `accept` and `cancel` press the buttons.
//! An `open` due while the player is not in the world (a start-up message box is up)
//! waits until they are, and the steps after it come as much later ([`run_aid`]).
//! For the mouse: `point=<x>:<y>` puts the pointer there (parts of the window's width
//! and height, 0 to 1), `press` and `release` are its left button; they go the way the
//! real pointer does (Bevy's UI finds what is under it).
//! At exit, when the menu was opened at all: "wait summary: …".
