//! The view narrows onto the speaker in a conversation (docs/design/dialogue-play.md
//! §8.8): the same conversations `crate::dialogue_look` turns the view for
//! (`Game::dialogue`). In the original the speaker's head comes out the same size from any
//! distance, about [`HEAD_SHARE`] of the view's height with the face's centre about
//! [`FACE_FROM_TOP`] of it from the top, so it is a framing and not a fixed zoom [observed:
//! the original, 2026-11-06, Doc Mitchell from about 90 and about 300 units].
//!
//! - **Field of view.** Worked out from the distance to the face and an assumed head
//!   ([`framed_vfov`]); never wider than the view the player has, never narrower than
//!   [`MIN_VFOV`]. It follows the speaker's distance slowly ([`FOLLOW_SECONDS`]), not the
//!   mouse: the player still looks around while zoomed.
//! - **Creatures and robots.** They are framed by how tall they are drawn, not by a human's
//!   head ([`creature_framing`]): the view grows with it, and the point lands lower so most
//!   of it shows, as with the original's Marcus, Victor and Mr. House [observed, 2026-11-06].
//!   Human-style actors (ACHR) keep the numbers above whatever their hit volume
//!   says: a hat or a seat changes that, and not their framing.
//! - **Framing.** The opening turn (`crate::dialogue_look`) aims [`face_drop`] under the
//!   face, so the face lands at [`FACE_FROM_TOP`], and stays on it for
//!   [`crate::dialogue_look::ZOOM_HOLD_SECONDS`] while the speaker finishes turning; after
//!   it, and at the first move of the mouse, the view is the player's [owner decision
//!   2026-10-10].
//! - **Looking around** is scaled with the zoom ([`DialogueZoom::look_scale`]), so the
//!   mouse moves the picture as far as it does unzoomed.
//! - **Who owns the field of view** (as `chargen/vigor.rs`'s `fov_before`). [`DialogueZoom`]
//!   keeps what was on the camera underneath its own value and gives it back. A value on
//!   the camera that is not the one it last wrote is someone else's (the settings slider,
//!   the console's SetCameraFOV, the sights' zoom): the new base, zoomed from at once. Who
//!   else reads a base asks [`DialogueZoom::underlying`] first, so a zoomed value never
//!   becomes one (`crate::aim_zoom`, `crate::free_cam`, `crate::chargen::vigor`).
//! - **Third person** ends in the same close-up: the camera travels to the first-person eye
//!   with the zoom and the body goes on the way ([`crate::control::TALK_CAMERA_CLOSE`]),
//!   and comes back when the conversation ends [observed: the original, 2026-11-06, the
//!   same framing and no body]. `PlayerControl::pov` is not touched: the player's own view
//!   is still what scripts and saves see.
//! - **No zoom**: through a talking activator (not in this version), a dead speaker, one
//!   that is not drawn, the free camera, the character creator, a kill camera; the Vigor
//!   Tester has the field of view for itself and gets it at once. A conversation that ends
//!   or stops being zoomable eases out.
//! - **Pausing**: the eases run on the virtual clock, so the Esc pause menu holds them.
//!   With `--menu-pause original` the picture stands still, so they complete at once.
//!
//! The depth of field that goes with it is nvforever's `imagespace.rs` ([`DialogueZoom::blend`],
//! [`DialogueZoom::face`]).
//!
//! Log, starting `dialogue zoom:`: one line as each ease ends, with the distance and the
//! angle reached; one line per conversation that gets no zoom, and why.
