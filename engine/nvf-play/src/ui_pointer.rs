//! The menus' three-state pointer feedback (none, hovered, pressed), kept by NVForever.
//!
//! Every menu reads a [`PointerState`] on its clickable nodes, mostly through
//! `Changed<PointerState>`. Bevy 0.20 deprecated its own `Interaction` and
//! `widget::Button` (gone in 0.21); their replacements (`Hovered`, the `Pressed` marker,
//! the headless `ui_widgets::Button`) activate a button on release and carry no
//! three-state value, which would change when every menu's clicks fire. So the state is
//! ours, and [`update_pointer_state`] keeps it with the timing the menus were built on:
//!
//! - a node turns `Pressed` on the frame the left mouse button (or a touch) goes down over
//!   it, so a click fires on press;
//! - it stays `Pressed` while the button is held, even when the pointer leaves it;
//! - on release it turns `Hovered` if the pointer is still over it, `None` otherwise;
//! - a node that is hovered and not pressed is `Hovered`, any other `None`;
//! - the topmost node under the pointer whose [`FocusPolicy`] is `Block` stops the nodes
//!   beneath it from being hovered or pressed; a hidden node is always `None`.
//!
//! These are the rules Bevy 0.20's `ui_focus_system` applies to `Interaction`, written out
//! again for our component (which Bevy's system no longer sees). `RelativeCursorPosition`
//! is not deprecated and Bevy still keeps it.
