//! The Pip-Boy (docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md): Tab raises the player's left arm with the
//! Pip-Boy to the view, and its screen shows the Pip-Boy menus, under three buttons on
//! the device (STATS, ITEMS, DATA), each with five tabs along the screen's foot.
//!
//! - **The menus are drawn into a texture** ([`PipBoyScreen`]): a 2D camera renders the
//!   menu's interface nodes into an image, and the player's body (nvforever,
//!   `pipboy_arm.rs`) puts that image on the Pip-Boy model's screen. The menus are laid
//!   out on a canvas 1024 × 768 [documented: `menus\globals.xml` `_pipboy_width` and
//!   `_pipboy_height`; the three menu files lay out inside it]. The image is 960 high so
//!   that a length of the interface (`interface::u`, 960 to the height of the view it is
//!   drawn in) is one of its pixels, and the canvas is its top left 1024 × 768 [design].
//!   Where nothing shows the model's screen (no body, no Pip-Boy worn) the image is drawn
//!   flat in the middle of the window instead [design].
//! - **Opening and closing.** Tab (the control Menu Mode) opens the player's inventory
//!   model (`menu::open_menus`, `Mode::Inventory`), which pauses the game
//!   (`PlayState::Menu`); while that model is open the Pip-Boy is up. One first-person
//!   clip, `characters\_1stperson\locomotion\male\pipboy.kf` (0.73 s,
//!   [`CLIP_SECONDS`]), both brings it up and puts it away: up to its `Hit` key (0.33 s,
//!   [`HOLD_SECONDS`]) the arm comes up until the screen is straight before the eye,
//!   facing it; after the key the arm goes away down [observed: the key; the screen's
//!   place against the camera through the clip, docs/spec-notes/pipboy.md §1]. So the
//!   clip is held at `Hit` while the menus are open and plays on from there when they
//!   close [hypothesis: the original holds it there]. The view is first person while
//!   it is up and goes back to what it was [hypothesis]. A script that has turned the
//!   Pip-Boy off keeps it down (`menu::open_menus`).
//! - **Pages.** [`Page`]: STATS, ITEMS and DATA, chosen by the buttons on the device (the
//!   body reports a click on one as [`PipBoyInput::Page`]) or F1, F2, F3 [hypothesis: the
//!   PC keys are not captured]; each page remembers its tab. The tabs: the names along
//!   the screen's foot, clicked, or A/D and Left/Right [design].
//! - **The pointer.** The window's pointer moves over the device; where it lies on the
//!   screen, it is passed to the menu's nodes as a pointer of their own
//!   ([`PIPBOY_POINTER`], Bevy's picking) so the menus take hovers and clicks as any
//!   other interface does. The body finds the spot on the model's screen
//!   ([`PipBoyScreen::pointer`]) on the shape as the arm's bones pose it (nvforever
//!   `pipboy_arm.rs`; Bevy's mesh ray casts see neither the skinning nor meshes kept on
//!   the GPU only, which is why clicks on the model did nothing until 2026-10-11); for
//!   the flat image this module finds it.
//! - **The screen menu** (docs/design/screen-menu.md): the same menus without the arm,
//!   the image drawn full screen over the world blacked out, as the barter menu is, with
//!   the device's three buttons as a header in place of the page's title. It is the
//!   frame in use ([`Frame`]) whenever the player wears no Pip-Boy, so the inventory never
//!   needs one, and when the Gameplay setting Use Pip-Boy is off, which also takes the
//!   Pip-Boy and its glove off (on puts them back on) [design: owner, 2026-10-31].
//!   Nothing moves the arm, the view or the blur then; the pages do not know which frame
//!   they are in.
//! - **Drawing.** [`frame`] draws what every page shares (the background, the tab line)
//!   and gives the pages their tools; each page module ([`stats`], [`items`], [`data`])
//!   fills the [`PageBody`] node with its own system, so a page can read what it needs.
