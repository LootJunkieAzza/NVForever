//! World data for Layer 3: worldspaces, cells, placed references and landscape,
//! resolved across a load order. No engine dependencies; the renderer consumes this.
//!
//! - [`audio`]: music types, media sets, acoustic spaces, audio markers and sound markers
//! - [`fields`]: schema-decoded access to one record's subrecords
//! - [`image_modifier`]: image space modifiers as animated screen effects
//! - [`imagespace`]: image spaces and the weather's adapters (the colour grade)
//! - [`index`]: which cells belong to which worldspace and which references to which cell
//! - [`placed`]: a placed reference (REFR/ACHR/ACRE/...) and the base object it places
//! - [`land`]: landscape heights, normals, vertex colours and texture layers
//! - [`grass`]: grass types and the plants generated on a landscape's textures
//! - [`lighting`]: interior cell lighting and light sources
//! - [`loadscreen`]: loading screens and the places they belong to
//! - [`sky`]: climate, weather and water records; time-of-day colours, sun and fog
//! - [`transform`]: reference rotation convention
//!
//! Format facts and confidence tags: `docs/spec-notes/world.md`.
