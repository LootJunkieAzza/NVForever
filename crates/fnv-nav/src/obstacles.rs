//! Obstacles: placed objects whose base is flagged Obstacle (record header bit 25 of STAT,
//! MSTT, ACTI, SCOL, CONT and LIGH [documented: xEdit wbDefinitionsFNV.pas flag lists;
//! schemas/fnv]) "dynamically cut the navmesh in game preventing actors from walking into
//! it" [documented: GECK wiki Activator, Flags].
//!
//! The navmesh is made in the editor around what stands in the cell, so an object that
//! is always there already has its hole. What the cut adds is for objects that come and
//! go: NVForever learns the references that can be enabled or disabled (Initially
//! Disabled, or with an enable parent) [hypothesis: the cut matters for those;
//! FalloutNV.esm places 59,925 obstacle references, mostly rocks and cliffs whose bounds
//! are far larger than their shape, and 149 that can come and go: sandbags, guard rails,
//! force fields, box cars, observed 2026-10-24], and cuts for one only while it is
//! enabled and was placed Initially Disabled: one placed enabled stood there when the
//! navmesh was made, so the navmesh already goes round it (or through it, where its
//! bounds are larger than its shape) [hypothesis; observed 2026-10-28: the sandbag
//! 0x00168F64 at Hoover Dam, placed enabled under the enable parent
//! VMQ03aGrahamRadioREF, has navmesh triangles under its bounds that join Colonel
//! Moore's patrol points 0x001377C5 and 0x001377C6 on her way to Kimball's podium; cut,
//! they split the deck and she never reached it]. The cut takes the
//! triangles under the reference's bounds (OBND, placed and scaled), seen from above,
//! whose heights meet the bounds from 64 units under the base to [`TOP_CLEAR`] under the
//! top [engine choice: a triangle near the top is on the object, not under it]
//! (docs/spec-notes/navmesh.md §7).
