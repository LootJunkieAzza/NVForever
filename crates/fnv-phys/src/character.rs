//! Kinematic capsule character controller (player and NPC movement), over rapier's
//! `KinematicCharacterController` with Z up.
//!
//! The character is a vertical capsule standing on its feet point. Each fixed step the
//! caller gives a horizontal velocity and whether jump is pressed; the controller
//! applies gravity to its own vertical speed, sweeps the capsule through the world
//! (sliding along walls, climbing steps up to `step_height`, refusing slopes steeper than
//! `max_slope_deg`, snapping down to the ground on descents) and moves its kinematic body
//! so dynamic bodies collide with it. Every value of [`CharacterParams`] is an unknown of
//! the original game [hypothesis]; physics.md §6 lists what to capture.
