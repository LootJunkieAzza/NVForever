//! What a placed reference contributes to the physics world: the collision objects of
//! its base object's model and of a CollisionMarker primitive. One rule shared by
//! `fnvtool phys` and the game (`engine/nvf-play`), so the two never diverge.
//!
//! Whether the reference is in the world at all (deleted, disabled, taken) is the
//! caller's decision: the tools read the plugins' flags, the game asks its simulation.
//! Models are read by the caller too ([`ModelCollision`]); fnv-phys never reads NIF
//! blocks (docs/design/layer4.md §7).
