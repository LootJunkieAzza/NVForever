//! The physics world: terrain heightfields, placed references' collision bodies,
//! characters, fixed-step stepping and scene queries over rapier3d.
//!
//! Determinism (docs/spec-notes/physics.md §5): rapier is built with
//! `enhanced-determinism`; the world advances only in fixed steps of `PhysParams::dt`;
//! bodies are created in the order the caller adds them, so callers add terrain by grid
//! and references by FormID (the `fnvtool phys` commands do). Query results that can
//! list several colliders are sorted. Shapes can be built away from the world
//! ([`PreparedRef`], [`PreparedTerrain`], e.g. on a loader thread) and inserted later;
//! the order of insertion is what counts.
