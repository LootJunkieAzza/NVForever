//! Carrying AI packages out (Layer 6): the step between the package an actor chose
//! (`fnv_game::ai`) and the actor being where that package wants it, over the navmesh
//! (`fnv_nav`). Headless; no Bevy. Design: docs/design/actor-behaviour.md §5; facts and
//! confidence tags: docs/spec-notes/packages.md.
//!
//! - [`alert`]: actors in a combat state search, or stand facing their target
//! - [`goal`]: where a package sends its actor
//! - [`carry`]: the actors the AI moves: reachability, the walk, arrival
//! - [`errand`]: Escort, Find, Use Item At, Ambush and Flee Not Combat packages
//! - [`progress`]: what of an actor's package progress a save keeps
//! - [`process`]: process levels: full updates in the loaded area, a cheap one now and
//!   then outside it
//! - [`sandbox`]: what a sandboxing actor does in its area
//! - [`social`]: actors who talk on their own: hellos to the player, random
//!   conversations
