//! Process levels: how much of the AI an actor gets by where it is (owner's playtest
//! 2026-10-11: Fiends near Camp McCarran were heard talking from Crimson Caravan).
//!
//! The original processes actors in levels [documented: GECK wiki (JIP)
//! GetActorsByProcessingLevel and GetActorProcessingLevel]:
//! - **High**: the actors of the loaded interior cell or of the exterior cells around
//!   (and including) the player's, uGridsToLoad (5 × 5 by default); "processed every
//!   frame";
//! - **Mid-High**: actors in exterior cells not loaded but visited recently and still
//!   in memory, "processed every ~18 seconds";
//! - **Mid-Low**: actors in interiors not visited but reached by doors from the loaded
//!   cells ("unknown at this time");
//! - **Low**: everyone else, "every ~120 seconds".
//!
//! An actor whose base has "No Low Level Processing" "does not update its AI unless it
//! is in the loaded area of the player" [documented: GECK wiki Category:NPC]; and with
//! SetSceneIsComplex "low and middle-low process levels do not update … they will not go
//! through load doors" [documented: GECK wiki SetSceneIsComplex], so outside it they do.
//!
//! Here the engine says where each actor is ([`Ai::set_level`], a [`ProcessLevel`]); the
//! AI keeps three levels [design, after the original's]:
//! - **high** (the loaded area): everything (packages, walks, sandboxes, combat states,
//!   Dialogue packages, hellos and random conversations), every update;
//! - **low**, out of the loaded area: an update now and then, in which it takes up its
//!   current package and walks on as far as the time owed since the last takes it, on
//!   the navmesh (doors as if open), as in an hour passed in the Wait menu
//!   ([`crate::Ai::pass_time`]): nothing that needs the player near: no sandbox
//!   behaviour, no combat state, no hello, no random conversation; a Dialogue package
//!   without a wait location only takes the actor towards its target, the talking waits
//!   for the high process.
//!   How often depends on where:
//!   - [`ProcessLevel::MidHigh`], cells left recently and still in the cell buffer (the
//!     engine keeps it: `uExterior Cell Buffer`, `uInterior Cell Buffer`): every
//!     [`LOW_PROCESS_SECONDS`];
//!   - [`ProcessLevel::Low`], everyone else: every [`FAR_PROCESS_SECONDS`];
//!   - [`ProcessLevel::Coming`], whatever the cell, an actor whose walk leads into the
//!     loaded area (the engine looks at the rest of its path): every frame, so it
//!     arrives when it would have walking in sight.
//!
//!   The original's Mid-Low (interiors reached by doors from the loaded cells, never
//!   visited, "unknown" rate) has no actors here: the AI only has the actors of cells
//!   loaded once, or moved by scripts.
//!
//! How the original carries an actor at the Low level to the player, watched with the AI
//! observer [observed 2026-10-24: Malcolm Holmes after the first star cap,
//! `tools/capture/observe/holmes_far_travel.campaign.json` and `holmes_far_moving`,
//! docs/spec-notes/ai-observer.md §13]: he stood still between jumps once per game hour
//! (one [`FAR_PROCESS_SECONDS`] at TimeScale 30) of 9,050–10,170 units along a route, not
//! a straight line: about a walk's worth (86.8 units/s), though his package has Always
//! Run. The jump that would have taken him into the loaded area stopped short at its
//! edge (5,330 units), and from there he ran in the high process. So here:
//! - at the Low level an actor walks, whatever its package says [hypothesis: one actor
//!   seen];
//! - a low-process walk stops where it comes into the loaded area ([`Ai::set_loaded`]),
//!   dropping the rest of the time owed;
//! - a Dialogue package without a wait location goes towards its target out of the high
//!   process too, on the route planned when it set off (`Ai::talk_step_far`); one with a
//!   wait location keeps its actor there [hypothesis: Ringo stays in the gas station].
//!
//! An actor whose base has "No Low Level Processing" gets no update at all out of the
//! loaded area, not even for hours passed in the Wait menu.
//!
//! Going low ends what needs the loaded area: a random conversation it walks to or waits
//! for (the other one goes back to its package), a search. Low actors' updates are
//! spread over the interval (each starts with a share of it owed, by its FormID), so a
//! crowd leaving the loaded area is not updated in one frame.
