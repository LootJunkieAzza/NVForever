//! Carrying out Escort, Find, Use Item At, Ambush and Flee Not Combat packages (the
//! goals [`Escort`], [`Find`], [`UseAt`], [`Ambush`], [`Flee`] of `crate::goal`). The
//! rules, their sources and confidence: docs/spec-notes/packages.md §3.1 and
//! docs/design/actor-behaviour.md §5.10; the walks are `crate::carry`'s.
//!
//! - **Escort**: it walks to the destination and stops whenever the one it leads is more
//!   than the escort distance away, facing it, until it is within the distance less
//!   [`ESCORT_SLACK`] again.
//! - **Find**: it goes to the search location, then looks in the area for what the
//!   package names, nearest first, goes to it and acts on it ([`Act`]), until it has
//!   found the package's count; with nothing (more) to find its goal is met and it looks
//!   again every [`LOOK_SECONDS`].
//! - **Use Item At**: it chooses what to use (the package's reference, the nearest free
//!   object of the package's kind in the area, or an item it carries), goes there and
//!   uses it.
//! - **Ambush**: it goes to the wait location and lies in wait there, standing still (with
//!   Hide While Ambushing too: the original's actor did not sneak, packages.md §4); the
//!   first enemy inside the trigger location sets it off: it starts combat with it
//!   (`Game::start_combat`) and its goal is met.
//! - **Flee Not Combat**: while something threatens it (the package's target, else the
//!   nearest actor, within the flee distance, that is its enemy: one of the two would
//!   attack the other) it runs, to the
//!   package's location or straight away; with nothing threatening it its goal is met
//!   and it stands. It never starts a fight.
