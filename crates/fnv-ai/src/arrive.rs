//! Actors already at their package's place when the player arrives (issue #1208).
//!
//! After a fast travel or a load door the original shows the destination's actors where
//! their current package has them: Boone at his post by the dinosaur when the player
//! fast travels to Novac at 5am, Cass already drinking at the Mojave Outpost's bar on
//! entering, the Goodsprings settler already seated in the Prospector Saloon [observed,
//! owner, issue #1208]. Ours walked there in front of the player: an actor of a cell
//! that was not loaded joined the AI at its editor place (or where the low process had
//! left it) and only then set off.
//!
//! So here the engine, while the loading screen of the player's own trip (a load door,
//! a fast travel; not a script's MoveTo) is up, hands the AI each actor near the
//! destination that was not in the loaded area shortly before the trip
//! ([`Ai::arrive`]); the AI takes up the actor's current package and, instead of
//! walking, puts it where the walk ends: at the package's place, on the furniture the
//! package or its sandbox gives it, at the patrol point it sets off for (one that goes
//! round: the nearest, as when its package begins) or at a patrol's last point (one that
//! goes once, its waits on the way over) [hypothesis: the original's actors were seen at
//! the place, not part-way; whether it puts them exactly at the end or somewhere within
//! the package's radius is for the observer, docs/handoff/observer-checks.md].
//!
//! Only a walk that starts near the player is skipped: in the loaded area, the cell
//! buffer or an interior behind a door of the loaded cells (the engine says which, the
//! `near` of [`Ai::arrive`]): Boone, in his room behind the motel's door, to the
//! dinosaur in the street. An actor farther away comes as the low process brings it,
//! stopping at the loaded area's edge ([`crate::process`]: Malcolm Holmes). Actors the
//! player could see shortly before the trip are never moved: the engine leaves them out
//! (a short fast travel inside the loaded area, or out of a house and straight back,
//! moves nobody [design, issue #1208]).
//!
//! Not put anywhere: an actor that is dead, unconscious, restrained, rooted, with its
//! AI off, not in the world, in a combat state (Alert, Combat, Lost) or just put
//! somewhere by a script (MoveTo, [`SCRIPT_MOVE_HOLD`]); one whose
//! package's place is the player or another actor (a hunter sent after the player would
//! land beside them); one following, escorting, searching, fleeing or in a
//! conversation (those walks depend on someone else, and go on as they do now).
