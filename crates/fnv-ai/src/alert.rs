//! Actors in a combat state (`fnv_game::awareness`; docs/design/alert.md §4): what the
//! AI has them do instead of their package.
//!
//! - **Alert and Lost**: the actor searches [documented: GECK wiki Category:Detection,
//!   "Alert and Lost actors search … if their package allows"]. It gets off furniture,
//!   walks to where its latest alarm is (what it noticed, heard or last saw), looks
//!   that way for a few seconds, then searches on: at the alarm again if it has moved
//!   (the hostile was noticed somewhere else), else at a random point around it within
//!   the first search radius. It walks, it does not run [engineering choice]. The Combat
//!   Search page that describes the original's search is not in the owner's export; the
//!   radii are FalloutNV.esm's fCombatSearchInteriorMinRadius and
//!   fCombatSearchExteriorMinRadius [observed: 256 and 512; hypothesis: the radius of
//!   the nearest search ring].
//! - **Combat**: the actor closes in on its target until it is within the distance it
//!   attacks from (`Awarenesses::engage`, which the engine's combat AI sets from its
//!   weapon), running, the way planned again as the target moves; there it stops and
//!   faces it. Without such a distance it holds its ground [design]. The attacks
//!   themselves are the engine's (nvforever `npc_combat`). A target it does not detect
//!   now it closes in on whatever the distance, halving the gap each time the way is
//!   planned, until it sees it again [design]. While it aims down its sights
//!   (`Awarenesses::aiming`, set by the combat AI) it walks instead of running, as the
//!   player does while aiming [design: the owner's wish, playtest list 2026-10-11, "the
//!   player and NPCs should not be able to move at full speed whilst aiming"].
//! - **Continue During Combat** (docs/design/alert.md §5.2, #2155): an actor whose
//!   current package has the flag (`Game::continues_during_combat`) carries its package
//!   out as if nothing had happened only while the flag holds it ([`Ai::package_holds`]):
//!   on the way of a Travel, Patrol, Find, Ambush or Use Item At package, not yet
//!   arrived and not yet taken up by the fight; on a Guard while its target is outside
//!   the guard radius, measured from the post to the target; and on a Use Weapon package
//!   (#2120, #2145). Anywhere else it fights as any other actor does, and goes back to
//!   its package's place once the fight is over [observed: Lanius left his marker within
//!   1.2 s and fought up to 2,557 units from it, then stood on it again 3 to 5 s after
//!   the fight; a knife trooper on a stand-in-place Travel fought up to 2,043 units from
//!   its post; checks 105 to 109].
//! - **Fleeing** (docs/design/combat-ai.md §12.2) [documented: GECK wiki Combat Flee]:
//!   an actor the combat AI has fleeing (`fnv_game::combat_group::Flight`, any combat
//!   state) runs, in this order of tries, through a door within fCombatFleeMaxDoorDistance
//!   that is not nearer its attacker than it is, to cover between
//!   fCombatFleeMinCoverDistance and fCombatFleeMaxCoverDistance from the attacker (a
//!   navmesh cover edge the attacker is beyond, `fnv_nav::CoverEdge`), or
//!   fCombatFleeNormalDistance straight away from it (turning up to 90° either way when
//!   the navmesh ends there); at the spot it stays, facing the attacker. Cornered (no
//!   way out) it stays where it is [design: the choice among doors and cover, nearest
//!   first]. At its spot or cornered a person hides crouched (`Game::sneaks`,
//!   `Game::at_flee_spot`; combat-ai.md §12.2.1).
//! - **Posts** (§12.1): a place the combat AI wants a fighter at (cover, a peek out of
//!   it, a flank, a step aside, a step back; `fnv_game::combat_group::Post`): it goes
//!   there, running unless it aims down its sights, and stands facing its target. A post
//!   it has no way to is dropped and it closes in as before. So is one whose way ends, or
//!   runs out of time, with the actor still [`POST_ARRIVAL`] or more from it: it holds or
//!   closes in on that same update, and what comes next is the combat AI's to choose.
//! - **Shared searches** (§12.5) [documented: GECK wiki Combat Search]: a hostile only
//!   noticed is searched for midway between the actor and it; the comrades searching for
//!   the same actor's alarm (`Game::search_party`) each take their own sector of the
//!   circle round the search's centre [design: the wiki splits the navmesh area; sectors
//!   stand in], [`SEARCH_POINTS`] points making one complete search; the first within
//!   the minimum search radius, later ones within the medium one; after
//!   iCombatTargetLostRemoveSearchCount complete searches the alarm is dropped
//!   (`Game::searched_once`).
//! - **Warnings** (in Normal; aggro radius and trespass, `Game::warning_to`,
//!   `fnv_game::aggro` "The look"): an actor warning the player stops and turns to it
//!   until the warning is over (it attacks, or the player is out of its radius or of the
//!   owned cell, or out of its sight), then goes back to its package as after a search
//!   [hypothesis].
//! - Back in **Normal**, the actor goes back to its package's place, as after a random
//!   conversation.
