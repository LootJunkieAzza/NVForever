//! Carrying packages out: each actor the AI looks after goes where its current package
//! sends it ([`crate::goal`]), over the navmesh, and the game is told when it is there
//! (`Game::package_goal_met`). A package whose location cannot be reached is set aside
//! for a while and the actor chooses again (`Game::block_package`).
//!
//! A Dialogue package ([`goal::Talk`]) is carried out here too: the actor waits where
//! the package has it wait, goes up to its target when the target is where the package
//! says, and starts the conversation with the player (`Game::force_greet`: a greeting
//! with the Goodbye flag is a conversation too) or says its line (`Game::say`);
//! docs/design/actor-behaviour.md §5.6.
//!
//! Movement here is `fnv_nav::Walker` (on the navmesh surface, no physics): the engine
//! moves actors near the player with collision instead and uses this for the rest.
//!
//! Escort, Find, Use Item At, Ambush and Flee Not Combat packages are carried out in
//! `crate::errand`, on the walks planned here.
//!
//! An actor that stands ([`Ai::stands`]) can be pushed aside by one that walks into it
//! ([`Ai::push`]: over the navmesh, as far as it has room); left alone again it goes
//! back to where its package has it (docs/design/actor-behaviour.md §5.7).
