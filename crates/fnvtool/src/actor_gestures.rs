//! `fnvtool actor gestures`: the talking and listening gestures the IDLE tree gives
//! actors in the dialogue menu (docs/spec-notes/idles.md §12). For each actor, in a game
//! where nothing has happened yet, it is put in a conversation with the player saying
//! `--line` (its mood is that line's first response's; without it Neutral) and the
//! tree is asked many times while it talks, then as many times while it listens (the
//! player choosing) (`Game::talk_gesture`, without replay
//! delays). Each pick is reported to the rules as played, as the engine does, so the
//! tree's `IsLastIdlePlayed` conditions see it. The picks are counted per idle and per
//! group (the node above the idle) (fnv.actor.gestures/1).
