//! Spread, bloom and recoil (docs/design/combat.md §5.1).
//!
//! The size of the spread is the documented New Vegas formula [documented: GECK wiki Gun
//! Spread Formula (New Vegas), owner export 2026-10-09]: the actor's spread (aiming,
//! moving, stance, crippled arms, requirements, skill, perks) plus the weapon's (Min
//! Spread), times the ammo's spread effects, turned into degrees with the conversion the
//! page's authors measured in the game. What is different here [design]: the actor's
//! spread widens a cone around the crosshair instead of swaying the weapon, and bloom and
//! recoil are added on top.
