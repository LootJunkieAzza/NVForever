//! The attack cycle of one wielded weapon (docs/design/combat.md §5.5): trigger, fire
//! rate, magazine, reload, regenerating ammo. Headless; the engine feeds input and clip
//! timing and acts on the events.
//!
//! Rate of fire [documented: GECK wiki Weapons]: automatic weapons fire `fire_rate` shots
//! per second while the trigger is held; a semi-automatic weapon's rate follows its attack
//! clip and attack multiplier, so the interval is the time of the attack clip's `a:` key
//! (its length when it has none) ÷ (attack multiplier × animation multiplier) when the
//! engine knows the clip, else 1 ÷ "Attack Shots/Sec" [observed 2026-10-19: the record's
//! Attack Shots/Sec is exactly that for the 9mm pistol, `1hpattackright.kf` `a:R` at 0.400
//! s ÷ 1.25 = 3.125, and the varmint rifle, `2hrattack8.kf` `a:8` at 1.267 s ÷ 1.54 =
//! 1.216; the clips end 0.03–0.1 s later; owner playtest: the original empties a magazine
//! faster than the clip's length allowed]. The shot leaves at the clip's `Hit` key
//! [documented: GECK wiki NiTextKeyExtraData], `fire_delay` after the trigger.
//!
//! Spin-up [documented: GECK wiki NiTextKeyExtraData, `Fire` "works like `Hit` and also
//! starts the internal loop of a clamped sequence; `Loop` jumps back to it"; owner
//! decision 2026-10-10]: an automatic weapon whose attack clip has that loop (a minigun's
//! `AttackSpin`) fires its first shot at the clip's `Fire` key, `spin_up` after the
//! trigger, then at its rate for as long as the trigger stays held. Letting go during
//! the spin-up fires nothing; every new pull, and firing on after a reload, spins up
//! again [design].
//!
//! Round by round (docs/spec-notes/combat-rules.md §4): a weapon whose reload animation
//! has an opening clip (`1hpreloadxstart.kf` beside `1hpreloadx.kf`: the .357 revolver,
//! the lever-actions, the hunting shotgun) opens once, then loads one round per pass of
//! the reload clip up to its `Hit` key and closes with the rest of that clip
//! [hypothesis: the `Hit` key "also ends looping reloads", documented: GECK wiki
//! NiTextKeyExtraData; observed: the sounds named after it are the `…ReloadEnd`, click
//! and cock sounds]. A fresh pull of the trigger stops it after the round in hand and
//! the weapon closes; the close plays every time [owner decision 2026-10-11]. The pull
//! that stops the reload only closes the weapon: it fires nothing [owner decision
//! 2026-10-11, playtest: "pressing attack mid reload to close cylinder fires a shot"].
//! A later pull while the reload is stopped or closing is kept for [`SHOT_GRACE`]: if
//! the weapon is closed within that time of the pull, the shot follows; else it is
//! dropped and a new pull is needed.
