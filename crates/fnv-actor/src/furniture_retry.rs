//! What a resident does after furniture refused it (docs/spec-notes/furniture.md §7,
//! docs/design/actor-behaviour.md, "Furniture"). The rules only, without the engine: the
//! engine (`engine/nvforever/src/furniture.rs`) says why it refused, the resident
//! (`engine/nvforever/src/residents.rs`) holds the state and gives the orders.
//!
//! All of this is [design], an NVForever choice; nothing here is claimed to match the
//! original game. Occupied furniture may come free, so the actor asks again after a wait;
//! any other refusal repeats for the same request, so it does not ask again until
//! something it depends on has changed.

/// How long an actor refused because the furniture is occupied waits before it asks again:
/// seconds of active play in which it could sit, not counting menus, conversations or
/// loading screens [design: an engineering number, not measured in the original; often
/// enough that a free seat is taken soon, rare enough that planning a use costs nothing].
