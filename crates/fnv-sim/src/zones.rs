//! Encounter zones and the level leveled lists are read at for one placed reference
//! (docs/spec-notes/encounter-zones.md).
//!
//! - A zone (ECZN, [`crate::forms::ZoneDef`]) gets its level the first time the player
//!   enters it: the player's level, raised to the zone's minimum level, except that a
//!   zone with "Match PC Below Minimum Level" takes a lower player's own level
//!   [documented: GECK wiki Bethsoft Tutorial NPC population, "if a second-level player
//!   enters an Encounter Zone with a min. level of 10, leveled lists in the Zone will
//!   spawn actors as though the player were level 10"; GetZoneFlag names the flag;
//!   hypothesis: what the flag does]. The level is then kept for good ("When the player
//!   enters an encounter zone for the first time, the level of that zone is set
//!   permanently", same page).
//! - A placed reference reads leveled lists at its zone's level, or at the player's level
//!   where it has no zone [documented: GECK wiki Reference, Leveled Actor: "If there is no
//!   encounter zone, which is common in the wasteland, the player's level is used"],
//!   changed by its level modifier (XLCM, [`modified`]).
//! - That level is fixed for the reference when its cell first comes into the loaded area
//!   ([`World::fix_level`]) [hypothesis: the game makes a leveled actor when its cell
//!   loads; fixing it keeps the actor the same one across later level-ups until its cell
//!   is reset].
