//! Lockpicking (docs/spec-notes/lockpicking.md): a locked door or container is picked
//! with a bobby pin and a screwdriver. The pin is turned to an angle on a half circle,
//! from the left (0°) over the top to the right (180°); the screwdriver then puts torque
//! on the lock. The nearer the pin is to the lock's sweet spot, the further the lock
//! turns; in the sweet spot it turns all the way (90°) and opens. A lock that stops
//! short strains the pin, which loses health and breaks when it has none left; the next
//! pin from the player's inventory goes in. Forcing the lock opens it or breaks it for
//! good.
//!
//! Pure rules: the engine's menu (`nvf-play` `lockpick`) feeds [`Picking::step`] the
//! pin's angle and whether torque is held, and draws what it reports. What the original
//! does is documented only in outline (its interface file, its help message, its menu
//! code and the scripting functions about locks); every number not tagged otherwise is
//! NVForever's own [design] and listed in docs/owner-review.md.
