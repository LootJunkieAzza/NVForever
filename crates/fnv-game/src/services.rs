//! Vendor services (docs/spec-notes/vendor-services.md): which item categories a vendor
//! sells, from its AI data's "Buys/Sells and Services" flags (or its class's, with
//! "Autocalc Service"), and whether it offers its services now (`GetOffersServicesNow`),
//! from its current package's "Offers Services" flag.
//!
//! - **The flags** [documented: xEdit wbServiceFlags, schema `gameplay.json`
//!   ServiceFlags; GECK wiki GetClassFlag, the same list two places on]: 0 Weapons, 1
//!   Armor, 2 Alcohol, 3 Books, 4 Food, 5 Chems, 6 Stimpaks, 10 Miscellaneous, 14
//!   Training, 16 Recharge, 17 Repair.
//! - **Whose flags**: the AI data's (NPC_/CREA AIDT), following the template while it
//!   supplies the AI data; an NPC with ACBS "Autocalc Service" uses its class's (CLAS
//!   DATA) [documented: GECK wiki Class, "If an NPC is set to auto-calc ... the buys/sells
//!   flags from their class are used. If the NPC is not Auto-calc'd, you can set their
//!   buys and sells flags directly"; hypothesis: the auto-calc meant is the "Autocalc
//!   Service" flag, the class is the one the traits give and the flag follows the AI
//!   data's template].
//! - **What they limit**: what the vendor sells. "Buys is not used in Fallout 3 or New
//!   Vegas and vendors can buy any item" [documented: GECK wiki Class].
//! - **An item's category** [`item_service`]: WEAP Weapons, ARMO Armor, BOOK Books
//!   [documented: GECK wiki Class, "Books: Can sell Skill Books"]; an ingestible by its
//!   equip type ETYP, 10 Chems, 11 Stimpak, 12 Food, 13 Alcohol [hypothesis: the wiki
//!   reads the ENIT flags, "Food: Ingestibles marked as food", "Chems: ... unmarked",
//!   "Stimpacks: ... marked as Medicine", and calls Alcohol unused; the equip types name
//!   the same four groups and fit the masters' vendors better: Nuka-Cola and Sunset
//!   Sarsaparilla (unmarked, ETYP Food) sit in the "FoodDrinkNoLiquor" lists that
//!   food-and-drink vendors such as Trudy (Alcohol, Food) stock, and the High Times
//!   dealer sells Alcohol and Chems; observed in FalloutNV.esm], falling back to the
//!   wiki's flags when the equip type is none of the four; AMMO and IMOD Weapons
//!   [hypothesis: Mick (Weapons, Armor, Repair) stocks bare boxes of ammunition and no
//!   Misc, observed]; everything else (MISC, KEYM, NOTE, LIGH, CHIP, CCRD, CMNY)
//!   Miscellaneous [hypothesis for all but MISC].
//! - **Offers services now** [`Game::offers_services_now`]: the actor's current package
//!   has "Offers Services" ("If the actor is a service provider, he will offer services
//!   so long as this package is running" [documented: GECK wiki Category:Packages]); not
//!   while it talks with another actor, nor while it is on its way to the package's
//!   location [documented: GECK wiki GetOffersServicesNow, notes: "false if the npc gets
//!   into a conversation with another npc or while moving to a destination", a travel
//!   package with the flag is "in a temporary NOT OFFER SERVICE state while they are
//!   moving"; hypothesis: "on its way" is the AI layer's Travelling phase before the
//!   goal is met, so an actor the AI does not move counts as there]; not in combat, nor
//!   dead [hypothesis]. A conversation with the player does not stop it [hypothesis: the
//!   function is meant for vendor dialogue conditions].
//! - **Not gated by it**: `ShowBarterMenu` opens whatever the package [observed: Chet's
//!   two packages and Mick's three have no "Offers Services" flag, yet both are the
//!   game's vendors through dialogue; no condition or script of FalloutNV.esm calls
//!   GetOffersServicesNow].
