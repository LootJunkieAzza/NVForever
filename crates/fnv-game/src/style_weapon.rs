//! The weapon a fighting NPC holds, by its combat style's Weapon Restrictions
//! (docs/spec-notes/companion-wheel.md §4).
//!
//! - **The rule** [documented: GECK wiki Combat Style, Simple tab, "Weapon Restrictions -
//!   Either None, Melee Only, or Ranged Only. If Melee Only is selected, the combatant will
//!   always use melee/hand-to-hand as their primary weapon. If Ranged Only is selected, the
//!   combatant will always use ranged weapons as their primary weapon"]: while an NPC
//!   fights, a weapon held that its style rules out is swapped for the carried weapon its
//!   style allows, the one with the highest damage as the outfitting's own choice counts
//!   it (a gun's explosion counted, the first carried on ties; `fnv_sim::World::equip_default`)
//!   [hypothesis: which of the allowed weapons the original takes is not documented]. With none allowed it keeps
//!   what it holds (a Melee Only actor holding only a gun fights with its fists,
//!   `npc_combat::arm_of`).
//! - **Melee and ranged** by the weapon's animation type [hypothesis: the style's words
//!   "melee/hand-to-hand"]: Hand to Hand, Melee (1 Hand) and Melee (2 Hand) are melee; the
//!   pistols, rifles, Handle and Launcher are ranged. Grenades, mines and thrown weapons are
//!   never taken up as the primary weapon [hypothesis].
//! - **No weapon held**: an NPC that fights with nothing equipped while it carries a weapon
//!   its style allows takes that one up as well [hypothesis: the GECK wiki's UnequipItem
//!   notes that companions do not stay unequipped, "NoEquipFlag … ignored by companions";
//!   generalised to every NPC in combat]. A weapon a script locked off (UnequipItem's
//!   NoEquip flag) and a broken one are not taken; one locked on is not swapped out
//!   (`fnv_sim::World::equip`).
//! - **Who**: NPCs only (creatures fight with their bodies' attacks), alive, in combat
//!   (`Game::fighting`), every frame, so a companion switched to melee or ranged on the
//!   companion wheel mid-fight (SetCombatStyle FollowersCombatStyleMelee /
//!   FollowersCombatStyleRanged, Melee Only / Ranged Only [observed: `fnvtool esm decode`])
//!   changes weapon at once. Out of combat nothing changes [hypothesis]. The swap is an
//!   ordinary equip: OnUnequip and OnEquip run, and the engine draws what the rules say
//!   the actor holds (`outfits::follow_inventory`).
