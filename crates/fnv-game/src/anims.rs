//! Animation groups scripts play on objects: `PlayGroup` and `IsAnimPlaying`
//! (docs/spec-notes/activators.md §5).
//!
//! The rules only record what is to be played ([`AnimRequest`], taken from
//! [`ObjectAnims::requests`] by whoever animates objects, and traced as `anim_asked`).
//! Playing it (the model's sequence of the group's name, its timing) is the engine's
//! work, which tells the rules what each reference plays ([`ObjectAnims::set_playing`])
//! so `IsAnimPlaying` can answer ([`ObjectAnims::driven`]). With nothing animating (a
//! headless run), nothing is ever playing [design: as `IsIdlePlaying`, `crate::idles`],
//! and at most [`crate::sound::MAX_PENDING`] requests are kept. Only the last group asked of each
//! reference is saved ([`ObjectAnims::asked`]): a gate a script opened and left open is
//! drawn, and collides, open after a load (issue #1396) [design].
//!
//! `LoopGroup` is not here: no script in the masters calls it and its opcode is not
//! known [observed: docs/spec-notes/script-functions-catalogue.md].
