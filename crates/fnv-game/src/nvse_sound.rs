//! The extenders' sound functions over the sounds scripts play (`PlaySound`,
//! `PlaySound3D`; `crate::sound`): IsSoundPlaying, StopSound, StopSoundAlt,
//! GetSoundPlayers, IsSoundPlayingFromPath [documented: their pages; observed: sound1, the
//! peer's captures of 2026-10-27].
//!
//! The rules keep each sound a script asked for ([`Played`]) until it ends; the engine plays
//! it and says how long it lasts or that it loops (`nvf_play::world_sounds`), and stops
//! what StopSound names. Headless, nothing says a sound ended: it counts as playing until
//! stopped [design].
