//! Idle animations asked for by the game's rules (Layer 6): a script's `PlayIdle`, a
//! package's begin / end / change idles and its idle collection, an idle marker's
//! collection, and the idles named on a dialogue response. Facts and their sources:
//! docs/spec-notes/idles.md.
//!
//! The rules only say *which* idle an actor is to play and why ([`IdleRequest`], taken
//! from [`Game::idle_requests`] by whoever animates actors, and traced as
//! `idle_asked`). Playing it (the `.kf` file, its length, its loops) is the animating
//! layer's work, which tells the rules what an actor plays ([`Game::set_idle_playing`])
//! so `IsIdlePlaying` can answer. With nothing animating, no idle is ever playing.
