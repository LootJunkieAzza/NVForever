//! Pickpocketing (docs/spec-notes/pickpocket.md): who may be pickpocketed, the chance
//! of each take or placement, being caught, and live explosives planted in an actor's
//! inventory ("exploding pants").
//!
//! - **Who** ([`Game::pickpocket_refusal`]): a living, present actor other than the
//!   player that is not hostile to the player and not a teammate; every NPC ("can all be
//!   pickpocketed" [documented: GECK wiki Category:NPC]) and the creatures flagged Allow
//!   Pickpocket (CREA ACBS bit 28 [documented: GECK wiki ActorHasBaseFlag]). Not a ghost:
//!   "Cannot be pickpocketed … Instead, regular activation (dialog) occurs" [documented:
//!   GECK wiki SetGhost notes]. Not one that has caught the player before: the game's
//!   `sNoPickPocketAgain` "has already caught you." [observed: FalloutNV.esm].
//! - **Chance** ([`Rules::chance`]): `(thief Sneak × fPickPocketActorSkillMult +
//!   fPickPocketActorSkillBase) + (target Sneak × fPickPocketTargetSkillMult +
//!   fPickPocketTargetSkillBase) + (item value × fPickPocketAmountMult +
//!   fPickPocketAmountBase)`, rounded down, kept within fPickPocketMinChance and
//!   fPickPocketMaxChance [documented: GECK wiki Pickpocket].
//! - **Caught** ([`Game::pickpocket_caught`]): the victim says Pickpocket ("Said by an
//!   actor if they notice you picking their pocket" [documented: GECK wiki Combat Tab])
//!   and turns on the player as for a seen theft; it will not be pickpocketed again.
//! - **Planted explosives** ([`Game::plant_explosive`]): a grenade or mine placed in an
//!   actor's inventory goes live; GetPlantedExplosive is 1 after
//!   `fProjectileInventoryGrenadeFreakoutTime` (the victim panics: `Game::panic_idle`
//!   in `crate::idles`), and after `fProjectileInventoryGrenadeTimer` it explodes,
//!   "always killing it regardless of its HP" [documented: GECK wiki Projectile notes],
//!   when its explosion hurts that kind of victim ([`Game::explosive_harms`]). Not on a
//!   child or an essential actor (it stays an ordinary item). Judged as a kill seen by
//!   whoever detected the player while it was live, credited to the weapon the player
//!   holds (docs/spec-notes/pickpocket.md §5).
