//! Radios in the runtime (docs/spec-notes/radio.md): which receivers are switched on,
//! whether a station broadcasts, the station's programme as dialogue (which line it
//! says next, with the line's begin and end result scripts), the conversations scripts
//! start, the Pip-Boy radio and actors made radios. No engine types; how a receiver
//! sounds, what the Pip-Boy receives and when lines play are the engine's (`nvf-play`
//! `radio.rs`).
//!
//! - **A receiver** (an activator whose base names a radio station) starts switched off
//!   and each default activation switches it on or off [hypothesis: the receivers'
//!   scripts — VintageRadioStartOnSCRIPT activates its own reference once on load, so a
//!   radio "starts on" only by being activated; radio.md §4]. The runtime counts the
//!   default activations of every reference whose activation is "activated"
//!   (activators, furniture), as scripts can activate a radio on the first frame, before
//!   the engine could say which references are receivers; the engine reads the counts of
//!   its receivers ([`Game::radio_on`]).
//! - **A station broadcasts** when SetBroadcastState last said so, else as its base's
//!   Continuous Broadcast flag says [documented: GECK wiki Radio Stations, "the default
//!   state … is set using the Continuous Broadcast checkbox"; hypothesis for which
//!   header bit that is, radio.md §2]. `GetBroadcastState` reads the same
//!   ([`Game::broadcasting`]).
//! - **The programme**: a station says lines as an actor does, with its placed reference
//!   as the speaker, so the radio quests' own conditions (GetIsID of the station) pick
//!   whose lines it has [observed: every radio quest of the masters gates its lines that
//!   way, radio.md §3]. It starts with RadioHello [documented: GECK wiki Radio Tab and
//!   Radio Stations: RadioHello starts radio conversations as HELLO does]. After a line
//!   it goes on with the topics the line leads to (its choices, TCLT, and the topics
//!   whose lines name its topic in their Link From, dialogue.md §3.5): one of them that
//!   has a line the station can say, picked at random [hypothesis: radio.md §5]; with
//!   none, back to RadioHello [hypothesis]. Within a topic the line is picked as for any
//!   speaker ([`Game::select_line`]: quest priority, stored order, Random pools), except
//!   that a line's fixed speaker does not keep the station from saying it: it names
//!   whose voice the line is in [documented: SetNPCRadio; observed: Black Mountain
//!   Radio's segments name Tabitha and Raul Tejada].
//! - **StartRadioConversation [topic]** asks for one conversation on the station: from
//!   the topic, else RadioHello, along the links until a line links nowhere; a
//!   broadcasting station is interrupted and goes on with its programme afterwards, a
//!   silent one plays the conversation and falls silent again, and the broadcast state
//!   is not changed [documented: GECK wiki StartRadioConversation]. The calls are kept
//!   for the engine ([`Radios::conversations`]), which times the lines.
//! - **The Pip-Boy radio** ([`PipBoyRadio`]): `PipBoyRadio 0` and `PipBoyRadioOff` turn it
//!   off, `PipBoyRadio 1 [station]` on (to the station given, else the last one listened
//!   to), `PipBoyRadio tune <station>` tunes it only while it is on [documented: GECK
//!   wiki PipBoyRadio, PipBoyRadioOff]. A disabled or out-of-range station "cannot be
//!   selected" [documented]: the tuning asked for waits in [`PipBoyRadio::tune`] for the
//!   engine, which knows where the player is.
//! - **SetNPCRadio [0/1] station**: the actor plays the station as a radio; 0 turns it
//!   off whatever station is named; an actor playing one keeps it until turned off
//!   [documented: GECK wiki SetNPCRadio notes]. The masters always give the 0/1 first
//!   [observed: the six calls of the masters' compiled scripts].
//! - `ForceRadioStationUpdate` "forces radio update" [documented: GECK wiki]: the engine
//!   looks at every radio each frame, so it is counted only [design].
