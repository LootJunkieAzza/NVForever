//! Time passing for the player's body: Hardcore's needs (dehydration, hunger, sleep
//! deprivation) rising with time, the stages of rads and of the needs (their actor
//! effects), and the hours of a wait or a sleep advancing active effects and needs
//! (docs/spec-notes/aid-items.md §6, §11).
//!
//! - **Needs rise** in Hardcore mode only, by one point every `rate` seconds of game-mode
//!   time, `rate` being `fHCStarvationRate` (25 in FalloutNV.esm) for hunger and
//!   `fHCSleepDeprivationRate` (50) for sleep deprivation [observed: the two settings
//!   and their values; hypothesis: the unit. The game's help says dehydration rises
//!   fastest, starvation slower and sleep deprivation slowest ("HelpHardcoreNeeds",
//!   documented in the masters), so the larger number is the slower need: a number of
//!   seconds per point]. Dehydration's rate is in no master [observed]: the code reads
//!   `fHCDehydrationRate` if a plugin has it [hypothesis: the name, by analogy] and else
//!   takes [`DEHYDRATION_RATE`], 10 s [documented: the owner's Hardcore table,
//!   2026-10-23, "~12/h (1 every 10s)"; the same table gives hunger "1 every 25s" and
//!   sleep "1 every 50s", which the two settings agree with].
//! - **Waiting and sleeping** "will also affect your needs" [documented: the help
//!   message]: an hour waited counts as the seconds of play in which an hour passes at
//!   the TimeScale (3600 / 30 = 120 s) for the effects' timers [hypothesis]. Each need
//!   rises by whole points an hour, the hour's seconds over its rate rounded down
//!   (120 / 10, 25, 50 = 12, 4, 2) [observed: the owner, 2026-10-31, Hardcore save from
//!   all needs at 0, Pip-Boy values: 3 hours waited gave H2O 36, FOD 12, SLP 6
//!   (observer-checks.md item 4, #1177); hypothesis: the rounding down]. An hour slept
//!   first lowers sleep deprivation by [`SLEEP_RECOVERY_PER_HOUR`] (never below 0)
//!   [documented: the owner's Hardcore table, 2026-10-23, "~ -60/h Sleep"] and then
//!   raises it by the hour's points as a wait does [observed: 3 hours slept from 0 gave
//!   SLP 2, H2O 36, FOD 12, the same owner's check; hypothesis: the order, which is
//!   what leaves 2 and not 0; one case].
//! - **Stages**: RADS, DEHY, HUNG and SLPD records give from which value each stage holds
//!   and its actor effect (200 Minor … 1000 Fatal). The player has the effect of the
//!   highest stage reached, added as AddSpell adds it, and loses it when the value drops
//!   below [hypothesis]. Rads' stages hold in every mode, the needs' only in Hardcore
//!   [hypothesis: radiation sickness is no Hardcore feature; the needs' stage effects
//!   are taken away when Hardcore is turned off]. Turning Hardcore off also sets the
//!   needs back to 0 [owner 2026-10-25].
//! - **Sleep heals crippled limbs** outside Hardcore: an hour slept takes away all the
//!   damage of the player's limb conditions [observed: FalloutNV.esm MESG
//!   `HelpHealingLimbs`, "to heal a crippled limb, you have three choices: sleep in a
//!   bed, find a doctor, or use a Stimpak"; "In Hardcore Mode, you may only heal crippled
//!   limbs by using Doctor's Bags or by visiting a doctor"; hypothesis: the first hour
//!   heals them all] (docs/spec-notes/crippled-limbs.md §6). The same sleep restores
//!   all Health; in Hardcore it heals neither [observed: the owner, 2026-10-31, "outside
//!   Hardcore a sleep restores Health and every crippled limb in full"; #1177].
//! - Only the player has needs here [design].
