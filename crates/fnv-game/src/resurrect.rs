//! ResurrectActor: a dead actor alive again (docs/spec-notes/resurrect.md).
//!
//! - **The rules** [observed: function probes fp5, 2026-10-17: after `KillActor player 0
//!   1` then `ResurrectActor 0` on Ringo, GetDead 0, GetCauseofDeath −1,
//!   GetHealthPercentage 1.0]: not dead or unconscious, its killer and cause of death
//!   forgotten, unharmed (every actor value's damage gone, the limbs' too [hypothesis:
//!   the owner's "generated again from its record", below]).
//! - **Generated again** [observed: owner, 2026-10-17: "resurrect rerolls any level list
//!   or random gen on the actor record so if it comes from a template with an item list
//!   or its a generic that can be male female all this will be re rolled on the
//!   resurrected actor"]: a dead actor's random choices are rolled again
//!   ([`RefExtra::rolls`](crate::game::RefExtra::rolls), the seed
//!   `fnv_sim::leveled::roll_seed`): the entry a leveled actor list stands for (which can
//!   be a man or a woman), and, when its carried items come through such a pick, the
//!   template they come from and the items themselves (`fnv_sim::World::reset_inventory`).
//!   An actor with its own item list keeps what it carries, looted or given [observed:
//!   capture rs1, 2026-10-17: Ringo given three Stimpaks, two taken from his corpse, one
//!   left after ResurrectActor 0]. What scripts gave it otherwise stays (factions,
//!   packages, actor values set, essential, AI off, dispositions) [hypothesis: the quests
//!   that resurrect companions and Yes Man rely on it].
//! - **Where**: where its body lies [observed: rs1: Ringo's reference followed his
//!   ragdoll from (685, -5602) to (730, -5609) and he stood up there, at once and still
//!   after 180 frames], which is where it died or where a script moved the corpse
//!   [observed: the shipped scripts move the corpse first, e.g. Yes Man's `MoveTo` to a
//!   marker and `ResurrectActor` after it, VMQYesManSupport, and the robot squads'
//!   `bot01.MoveTo` then `bot01.ResurrectActor` a frame later, decompiled 2026-10-17].
//!   The engine tells where the body came to rest ([`Game::stand_where_the_body_lies`]).
//!   It stands there in its default standing pose [observed: owner, 2026-10-17: "they
//!   respawn in their default standing position"; rs1: standing in the first frame after
//!   ResurrectActor 0, GetKnockedState 0 throughout].
//! - **The animate flag** (0 just standing, 1 standing up [documented: GECK wiki
//!   ResurrectActor]) is kept with the resurrection for the engine; both stand at once
//!   [design: the owner, 2026-10-17, "we shouldnt need a getup animation for
//!   resurrect"]. (With 1 the original showed a torn body in the air for a second or two,
//!   GetKnockedState 0, then the actor walking on [observed: rs1 screenshots]; not
//!   copied.)
//! - **A living actor** (scripts call it from OnHit when Health is below 0, decompiled)
//!   is only healed: nothing is rolled again [hypothesis: generating a living actor again
//!   would strip a companion of its gear].
//! - **Not loaded**: the rules are the same; it stays where it was and is drawn alive
//!   when its cell is [observed: rs1: Chet killed and raised in the unloaded general
//!   store, GetDead 0, position unchanged, standing when the player arrived].
//! - It leaves combat (`Game::stop_combat`) [hypothesis: a new actor starts calm].
