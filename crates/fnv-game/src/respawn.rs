//! Cell resets: dead actors flagged Respawn come back (docs/spec-notes/dead-on-spawn.md §4;
//! owner's playtest 2026-10-12, far-world leftovers).
//!
//! - **When** [documented: GECK wiki SetZoneRespawns, "Respawn rate on zones is controlled
//!   by a gamesetting: iHoursToRespawnCell (default setting is 72 hours)"; IsCellExpired, a
//!   cell "has expired and going to be reset on the next load (happens 3 days after the
//!   last visit)"; ResetInterior, the cell "has to be loaded in order to get cleaned up"]:
//!   a cell the player's loaded area left starts its clock then (GameDaysPassed,
//!   `fnv_sim::World::detach_cell`); when the loaded area takes it in again after at least
//!   `iHoursToRespawnCell` game hours (`fnv_sim::World::respawn_hours`: 72 when no plugin
//!   sets it), the cell is reset before anything in it runs.
//! - **Who comes back** [documented: GECK wiki Category:NPC: the flag Respawn,
//!   "References of this NPC in the world will be recreated after three days"; the note on
//!   Base Health 0, "the 'Respawns' flag must not be ticked or the actor will respawn alive
//!   after 3 days"; ResetInterior, "Unlike a time-based cell reset, this scripted reset does
//!   NOT resurrect Actors"]: every dead actor reference placed in that cell (its authored
//!   cell) whose base has Respawn — the template's flag with the template flag "Base Data"
//!   ([`crate::data::ActorDef::template_base`]). Corpses laid out by a new game (Base Health
//!   0, `Game::lay_out_corpses`) are dead actors like any other.
//! - **How** [hypothesis: "recreated" read as the reference starting again as authored]:
//!   alive, at its authored place and facing, with its authored inventory rolled again
//!   (`fnv_sim::World::reset_inventory`), and none of its run-time state (actor values and
//!   damage, killer, factions, packages: `RefExtra` dropped). The wiki's "with 0 HP" is not
//!   copied: it comes back with its full health [design: an actor alive at 0 health has no
//!   meaning here; the owner checks].
//! - The cell's scripted references run their OnReset blocks (`Game::cell_reset_blocks`).
//! - Respawning containers in the cell go back to their authored contents
//!   (`fnv_sim::World::attach_cell`, docs/spec-notes/simulation.md §3).
//! - Not done: the encounter zone flag "Never Resets" [documented: GECK wiki, containers in
//!   such a zone do not respawn]; removing the bodies of killed actors that do not respawn
//!   ("Quest Item: Dead body isn't removed when the cell regenerates", Category:NPC);
//!   ResetInterior.
