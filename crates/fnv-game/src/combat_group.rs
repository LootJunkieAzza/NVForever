//! Combat groups: actors fighting together, fleeing, alarms to allies, searches shared
//! out, and fights between actors (docs/design/combat-ai.md §12).
//!
//! What the GECK wiki's combat pages describe [documented: GECK wiki Confidence, Combat
//! Flee, Combat Search, Combat Style; the owner's export `Combat.xml`]:
//! - **Combat groups**: the actors on one side of a fight. Here a group is an actor and
//!   every actor in a combat state that is its ally or friend (`Game::reaction_to`:
//!   faction reactions, a faction or base form in common) and has a foe in common with
//!   it (a target or an alarm's owner) [engineering choice: the wiki names combat groups
//!   but not how they form].
//! - **Group threat ratio** [documented: Confidence]: the sum of the group's combat
//!   strength (health counting armour × damage per second) over the sum of its foes'.
//!   An actor flees when that is below its confidence threshold; one whose combat style
//!   has "Flee Based on Personal Survival" also flees when its personal ratio (its own
//!   health over the foes' average damage per second, against their average health over
//!   its group's average damage per second) is below it. Frenzied actors never flee.
//!   Each confidence boost (an actor at its flee spot attacked or cornered) raises its
//!   rating one level for the rest of the fight ([`Tactics::boosts`]).
//! - **Alarms** [documented: Confidence, Alarms]: an actor that starts fighting sends an
//!   alarm to summon help unless its foe is a minimal threat: group threat ratio at or
//!   above (confidence threshold + 0.5) × the alarm confidence multiplier (the wiki's
//!   example, 3; no game setting of FalloutNV.esm names it [observed]).
//! - **Searches** [documented: Combat Search]: the group searches together, splitting the
//!   area; after iCombatTargetLostRemoveSearchCount complete searches (FalloutNV.esm: 2
//!   [observed]) it drops what it searched for.
//!
//! On top, NVForever's own design [design]:
//! - an actor that **notices** a hostile (Normal → Alert) alarms its allies near it too,
//!   so a camp wakes as one (the owner's list 2: "alerting their friends when they sense
//!   an enemy presence");
//! - **NPC against NPC** hits ([`Game::attacked_by_actor`]): a hit by an actor the victim
//!   would leave alone starts a grudge as the player's hits do (`crate::provocation`),
//!   except a stray hit between allies or friends, or between two actors both fighting
//!   someone else (the owner's exception, applied to everyone);
//! - **posts** ([`Post`]): where the engine's combat AI wants a fighter to stand (cover,
//!   a peek out of it, a flank, a step aside to clear a friend from its line of fire);
//!   `fnv_ai::alert` walks it there.
//!
//! Only actors in the high process take part: the engine measures, fights and alarms
//! only drawn actors near the player (`fnv_ai::process`), and passes them in.
