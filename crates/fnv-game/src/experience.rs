//! Experience and levels (docs/spec-notes/experience.md): what each level needs, the
//! level cap, where the player stands between two levels (the HUD's XP meter), and when
//! the player has earned a level (the level-up menu opens; `crate::levelup`).
//!
//! - Experience comes from kills (`crate::combat`), picked locks (`crate::lockpick`),
//!   hacked terminals (`crate::terminal`), disarmed mines (activation), Fallout 3 style
//!   speech challenges (`crate::dialogue`), found places (the engine's compass) and
//!   scripts (`RewardXP`). Each goes through [`award`], which applies the perks' Adjust
//!   Experience Points entry point (Swift Learner, Skilled, ...) and adds to
//!   `PlayerState::xp`.
//! - The level is `PlayerState::level` (the configuration's until something sets it);
//!   reaching a level's experience does not raise it by itself: [`level_up_due`] says a
//!   level is earned, and [`level_up`] raises it and opens the menu (the engine calls it
//!   when the player can take the menu: no [`hunters`]).
