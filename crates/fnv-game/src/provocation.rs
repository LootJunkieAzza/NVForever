//! Being attacked: assault, friendly fire, yielding and assistance
//! (docs/design/combat-ai.md §10; owner's playtest list 2026-10-11).
//!
//! Who attacks whom on sight is [`Game::would_attack`] (aggression against faction
//! relations). This module adds the fights that start because someone was **hit**, and
//! how they end:
//!
//! - **Assault** [documented: GECK wiki Friendly Fire, "Neutral: aggro immediately on
//!   player when attacked, in or out of combat"]: an actor the player hits that would not
//!   attack the player holds a **grudge** against the player from then on, so it fights
//!   (`would_attack` is true for the pair) and says its Assault line [documented: GECK
//!   wiki Combat Tab, "Said when the actor is first attacked"]. Enemies that are not
//!   aggressive enough to attack on sight are treated the same [design].
//! - **Owner's exception** (playtest list 2026-10-11): a neutral actor already fighting
//!   someone else, hit by the player while the player is fighting too, does not turn on
//!   the player (a stray shot in a shared fight) [design].
//! - **Friendly fire** [documented: GECK wiki Friendly Fire]: a Friend (faction reaction 3)
//!   turns on the player at once out of combat (iFriendHitNonCombatAllowed hits allowed)
//!   and only after more than iFriendHitCombatAllowed hits in combat; an Ally (reaction 2,
//!   and the player's teammates [hypothesis]) after more than iAllyHitNonCombatAllowed
//!   hits out of combat and never in combat (iAllyHitCombatAllowed, 1000 or more meaning
//!   never). A hit counts only fFriendMinimumLastHitTime after the one before, and runs
//!   out after fFriendHitTimer. GetFriendHit returns the count; an ally in combat never
//!   counts above 1. SetIgnoreFriendlyHits makes a friend or ally ignore them all
//!   [hypothesis: what the function's name says].
//! - **Yielding** [documented: GECK wiki Yielding]: the player yields by putting the weapon
//!   away within fCombatYieldTime (10 s) of the fight's start. Only actors fighting
//!   because the player attacked them (a grudge, not their records or StartCombat)
//!   accept: they stop fighting, say AcceptYield, and forget the grudge. The owner's rule
//!   (playtest list 2026-10-11): an actor that forgave the player within
//!   fCombatYieldRetryTime (600 s) and was attacked again ignores the yield. The wiki's
//!   timer is the player's (no one accepts a yield again until it runs out); ours is each
//!   actor's [design: the owner's wording, "if they have already recently forgiven"].
//! - **Assistance** [documented: GECK wiki GetFactionCombatReaction, "An actor's
//!   Assistance setting determine whether it will help an Ally / a Friend in combat or
//!   not"; the codes 0 Helps Nobody, 1 Helps Allies, 2 Helps Friends and Allies:
//!   xEdit AIDT]: an actor that detects an ally (or a friend, with code 2) in a combat
//!   state takes up that ally's fight against each actor the ally fights, unless it is
//!   itself an ally or friend of that actor. It holds a grudge as an assaulted actor does
//!   and is alarmed at the attacker's position. Actors sharing a faction, or placed from
//!   the same base form, count as allies [engineering choice, as `would_attack` never
//!   lets them fight each other].
//! - **Cowards stay out** [documented: GECK wiki Confidence, "Cowardly … I will always
//!   flee from combat"; owner's playtest list 4, item 14: confidence and aggression must
//!   override the helps-allies join]: an actor whose Confidence is Cowardly never takes up
//!   another's fight, by assistance here or by an alarm (`crate::combat_group`); it
//!   still fights whom its own records make it attack, and whoever attacks it. Avoiding
//!   the fight (running from it) is not built (combat-ai.md §11, "Avoiding threats out of
//!   combat") [design: Unaggressive alone does not keep a helper out; the wiki's
//!   Unaggressive only says whom an actor might avoid].
//! - **A danger to itself** [design: owner's playtest list 5 item 35, "Sunny and her dog
//!   should fight as soon as the geckos aggro on the player"]: an actor that detects an
//!   attacker fighting the player or itself, where that attacker would attack it too
//!   (Very Aggressive geckos attack everyone), takes up the fight against it at once, as
//!   if helping the attacked one, instead of waiting to be hit. Not cowards, not actors
//!   whose package is Defensive Combat, not against an ally or friend of its own. Fights
//!   between other actors are left to assistance and alarms (above, and
//!   `crate::combat_group`): with this rule there too, every NCR trooper near Cook-Cook's
//!   camp took the fight up on its own and fewer alarmed the others.
//! - **Escorts** [documented: GECK wiki Defensive Combat, "The exception is for the
//!   Accompany, Escort and Follow packages … if the target is attacked, the actor will
//!   join into the combat"]: an actor whose current package is Escort takes up the fight
//!   of the one it escorts (the package's target) against everyone attacking it: actors
//!   in a combat state with the charge on their target list, and whoever hurt it. Its
//!   Assistance does not matter; it never fights its own allies or friends, and a coward
//!   stays out. Choices [hypothesis]: the escort must perceive its charge (band
//!   Detected, as for assistance); a fight the charge starts is joined only once the foe
//!   fights back; a charge that provoked the attacker is still helped; it holds for the
//!   whole package, also once at the destination; the player's teammates are left to
//!   `crate::followers`. Follow and Accompany (the same exception) are not built here.
//!
//! A grudge ends when its holder goes back to Normal, on StopCombat, and on an accepted
//! yield. Hits by actors other than the player go to `Game::attacked_by_actor`
//! (`crate::combat_group`, NPC against NPC).
