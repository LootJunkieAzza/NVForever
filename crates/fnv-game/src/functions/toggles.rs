//! Console functions the catalogue lists without an opcode (docs/design/console.md):
//! the console types them by name, and the function table gives each a number of ours
//! (`fnv_script::table::CONSOLE_OPCODE_BASE`), never in compiled scripts. They are registered
//! here by catalogue name ([`super::console_registry`]).
//!
//! The world and render toggles: the game's own (actors' AI, detection of the player,
//! scripts) are switched here and read by the AI, detection and [`Game::tick`]; the
//! engine's (collision, god mode, the drawing of grass, sky, water, trees, distant land
//! and navmesh) are asked of the engine in [`Toggles::asked`], which switches them and
//! prints their new state in the console.
