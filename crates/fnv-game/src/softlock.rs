//! The soft-lock watchdog (issue #2365): the player is held and nothing in the game is
//! moving on to let them go.
//!
//! All of it is [design]: the original has no such check. A soft lock is a hold that no
//! key ends, so it is found by what the game's own state says, not by what is drawn:
//!
//! | kind | the hold | limit |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `controls_held` | scripts have the movement controls off (`DisablePlayerControls`), or the player is restrained, outside any conversation or menu, and no story event has happened | [`CONTROLS_SECS`] |
//! | `dialogue_dead_end` | a conversation is open with no line being said and no choice offered | [`DEAD_END_SECS`] |
//! | `line_never_ends` | one response of a conversation has been the line being said | [`LINE_SECS`] |
//! | `menu_never_opens` | a menu the scripts opened holds a conversation and the caller says no screen answers for it (#2308: ShowRepairMenu from a line's result script) | [`MENU_SECS`] |
//!
//! **Story events** ([`story`]) are the game's own events that say a scene goes on: quest
//! stages and objectives, references enabled, disabled, moved or placed, activations,
//! messages, menus, conversations and their lines, image modifiers, knock-outs. Not among
//! them: variables and globals (a timer that counts forever would hide the hold), package
//! choices and conversations between actors (the residents of a town make them all day),
//! chatter ([`Game::chatter_topic`]: hellos and the lines of Combat and Detection topics,
//! which say nothing about the scene; a fight beside a held player went on for a minute
//! with no finding before they were left out), and items changing hands between others
//! (a fighter's spent rounds). `Game::emit` counts them in [`Seen`].
//!
//! The clock is the caller's: seconds in which the game ran (not the pause menu, not a
//! loading screen). One finding per hold; it is armed again when anything of the hold
//! changes.
