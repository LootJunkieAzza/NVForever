//! Scripted weapon use: the `UseWeapon` function and the Use Weapon package
//! (docs/design/use-weapon.md, docs/spec-notes/use-weapon.md).
//!
//! Both give an actor a [`WeaponUse`]: a weapon, a place to stand, a target, how many
//! shots, and the behaviour flags (always hit, do no damage, crouch to reload, hold fire
//! when blocked). The layer that moves actors (`fnv_ai`) walks it to its place and turns
//! it to the target, then reports it is in place ([`Game::weapon_use_in_place`]); the
//! engine fires the shots, counting them here ([`WeaponUse::shot`]), and ends the use
//! when they are spent ([`Game::end_weapon_use`]).
//!
//! - **The function** [documented: GECK wiki UseWeapon (Function)]: weapon, where to
//!   stand, target and number of shots; crouch to reload and hold fire when blocked
//!   default to on, always hit and do no damage to off; the last argument is where the
//!   target has to be for the actor to fire ("default/NULL means anywhere"; the page's
//!   example passes a marker reference). The shots are one volley of that many
//!   [design]. A use from a script comes before the actor's package and its combat
//!   state while it lasts [hypothesis: the shipped scripts call StartCombat together
//!   with UseWeapon, e.g. a trigger that has an actor fire four shots and then fight
//!   the player, so the use must not wait for the fight; observed: FalloutNV.esm SCPT
//!   0x000FED52]; once spent it is gone and the actor goes back to its package (or its
//!   fight).
//! - **The package** [documented: xEdit PACK PKW3 field names; the meanings below are
//!   our reading of them]: location 1 is where to stand, target 1 the weapon (a weapon
//!   form, or an object type: then what the actor holds), target 2 whom to shoot. Fire
//!   count "Number of Bursts" fires that many volleys, "Repeat Fire" goes on for as
//!   long as the package runs; each volley is a random number of shots between Shots
//!   Per Volley min and max, and between volleys "Volley Fire" waits a random time
//!   between Pause Between Volleys min and max while "Auto Fire" goes straight on
//!   [hypothesis]. Spent, the package's goal is met (its end script runs) and the actor
//!   stays in it until it chooses again [design, as a Dialogue package that has
//!   talked]. A package's use waits while the actor is in combat, as other package
//!   doings do [design].
//! - **Weapon**: the function equips the named weapon when the actor carries it; the
//!   page's "or grab one if one was nearby" is not built [design].
//! - **Melee** (docs/design/use-weapon.md §3.1): with a melee weapon, fists or a
//!   creature's own attack, each "shot" is a blow. Once in place, a script's use closes
//!   in on its target within the reach the engine sets ([`WeaponUse::reach`]) and swings
//!   there [hypothesis: the page says only "how many times to use the weapon"; a blow
//!   from where the actor stands would never land].
//! - Not part of the saved state: a use in progress is lost with a load [design].
