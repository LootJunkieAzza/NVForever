//! Karma, ownership and crime (docs/spec-notes/crime-karma.md; owner's playtest list 2 of
//! 2026-10-12, "FACTION KARMA" and "CRIME").
//!
//! - **Karma** is the player's actor value Karma (23). An actor's alignment is its Karma
//!   against the globals `KarmaVeryEvil` (−750), `KarmaEvil` (−250), `KarmaGood` (250)
//!   and `KarmaVeryGood` (750) [observed: FalloutNV.esm; using them as the bounds:
//!   hypothesis by their names, §1]. Every change goes through [`Game::change_karma`],
//!   which leaves a [`Note::Karma`] for the engine's corner message ("A corner message is
//!   shown … indicating the change" [documented: GECK wiki RewardKarma]).
//! - **Ownership** (§2): a reference's own owner (XOWN, a faction with the rank XRNK
//!   needs), else its cell's (XOWN/XRNK of the CELL, or SetCellOwnership) [documented:
//!   GECK wiki IsOwner, "inherited ownership from the cell"; Reference, "Faction Rank
//!   required to own the reference"]. The player owns what is owned by the player's base
//!   or by a faction the player is in at the rank asked for.
//! - **Crimes** (§3) [documented: FalloutNV.esm message `HelpCrime`]: minor crimes (theft,
//!   and "trespass": opening an owned lock) make only the victim hostile, and only when
//!   it sees the crime; major crimes (assault, murder) the victim and the victim's
//!   friends. Who sees: an actor that has the player detected ([`crate::detection`],
//!   band Detected) [hypothesis: "sees" is detection]. A reacting actor becomes a
//!   **crime enemy** of the player (GetActorCrimePlayerEnemy): it attacks the player
//!   whatever its aggression ([`Game::crime_enemy`], read by `Game::would_attack`)
//!   [design, as an assaulted actor's grudge].
//! - **Karma for crimes and kills** (§4): stealing, and opening an owned lock, cost
//!   `fKarmaModStealing` (−5) unless the owner is Evil (an Evil faction, or an owning
//!   actor of Evil alignment) or a faction that does not track crime [documented: GECK
//!   wiki Category:Factions, Evil and Track Crime; Reference, "karma gain/loss is affected
//!   by the karma level of the owning actor"; the lock: design]; killing an Evil actor
//!   gives no karma [observed: crime-karma.md §4.1], a Very Evil one
//!   `fKarmaModKillingEvilActor` (100) [documented: the setting; hypothesis: that it is
//!   for Very Evil]; killing a Good or Very Good one takes as much [design];
//!   murdering a Neutral NPC takes a quarter of it [design]. NPCs only [design].
//! - **Trespassing** in a cell (§3.3): in an owned cell without the Public place flag
//!   that the player does not own [documented: GECK wiki SetCellPublicFlag, "Cells which
//!   are public cannot have trespassing"]; an owner who sees the player there warns
//!   (GuardTrespass) every `fAITrespassWarningTimer` (5 s) up to `iGuardWarnings` (2)
//!   times, then attacks [documented for Guard packages, GECK wiki Guard Package;
//!   hypothesis: the same for owned cells].
//!
//! The engine tells the game what the player did ([`Game::player_stole`],
//! [`Game::player_opened_lock`], [`Game::crime_tick`]); kills and hits come through
//! `Game::kill` and `Game::attacked_by`.
