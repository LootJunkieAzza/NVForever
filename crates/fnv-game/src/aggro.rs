//! The aggro radius: an actor that does not attack the player on sight warns a player
//! who comes too close and then attacks (docs/design/combat-ai.md §13; owner's playtest
//! list 4, item 18).
//!
//! - **The records** [documented: xEdit AIDT field names "Aggro Radius Behavior" and
//!   "Aggro Radius"]: the AI data (from the template while the template flag "AI Data"
//!   is set) turns the behaviour on and gives the radius in game units. The current
//!   package must allow it: "Aggro Radius Behavior: Allow aggro radius behavior (if any)"
//!   is one of the package's Fallout behaviour flags [documented: GECK wiki
//!   Category:Packages], read as `fnv_ai::social::allows` reads them (a package without
//!   "Skip Fallout Behavior" allows them all); an actor with no package allows it
//!   [hypothesis]; a package with "No Warn/Attack Behavior" does not [hypothesis: the
//!   flag's name].
//! - **The warning** [documented: GECK wiki Combat Tab, GuardTrespass "Said when issuing a
//!   warning, either from a Guard package, Aggro Radius behavior, or when the player is
//!   trespassing"; GetTrespassWarningLevel counts the warnings "an actor on a Guard
//!   Package (or responding to trespassing or responding to an aggro radius violation)"
//!   gave]: while it has the player detected (band Detected, measured within the last
//!   second) inside the radius, it says GuardTrespass every fAITrespassWarningTimer
//!   (5 s) up to iGuardWarnings (2) times, then attacks: a grudge ([`Why::Aggro`]) makes
//!   `Game::would_attack` true for the pair [hypothesis: the guard package's rule,
//!   `crate::crime`'s for trespassing; creatures have no GuardTrespass lines and warn
//!   in silence]. The count clears once the actor has gone twice the warning timer
//!   (10 s) without warning, i.e. after leaving the radius or losing the player for
//!   that long; a short loss of detection while it wanders keeps the count [decision,
//!   2026-10-13: clearing it at once let wandering geckos warn forever and never attack].
//!   An actor that has started warning also keeps counting while the player is only in
//!   its alert band (Noticed: it knows where the player is but does not see them, e.g.
//!   walking past with its back turned) [decision, same reason].
//! - **The look** [hypothesis: the idle tree; owner's playtest 2026-10-24, "baby geckos
//!   were not showing the aggressive stay away from me warnings"]: while it warns (from
//!   its first warning until it attacks or the player is out of its radius or unwatched
//!   at an aggro tick) the actor draws (`Game::draws_weapon`): a person its weapon, a
//!   creature its unarmed stance; the AI stops it and turns it to the player
//!   (`fnv_ai::alert`); GetCurrentAIPackage reads 35 and GetCurrentAIProcedure 44
//!   (GUARD). It is not alerted: GetIsAlerted stays 0, so the gecko's combat idles
//!   (NVGeckoCombatIdles 0x0011D9E9: IsMoving != 1 and GetIsAlerted 1 or the combat or
//!   flee procedure) wait for the fight [observed, original game, capture `warnings`
//!   young_gecko 2026-10-24: Young Gecko VERGSGecko6REF stopped and turned to the player
//!   (within 1 degree) in the sample after the player came inside 500 units; package a
//!   form made at run time, type 35, procedure 44; GetAnimAction 0 "equip weapon",
//!   IsWeaponOut 0 and GetIsAlerted 0 until it fought, then IsWeaponOut 1 and procedure
//!   13]. Without the look a creature warned in silence while it walked on, and the
//!   player saw nothing before the attack.
//! - **The timing** [observed, original game, captures `warnings` and `warnings2`
//!   2026-10-24/25, TimeScale 30, the player standing still]: a creature attacks 15 s
//!   after its warning began (Young Gecko Hunters 15.0 / 16.7 s at 607-618 of 650; a
//!   Young Gecko 15 s at 387-393 of 500; the coyote VERGSCoyote6REF 15 s at 727 of 1024),
//!   a person 21-22 s (Gomorrah's cash-room guard, four runs at 66-90 of his 128):
//!   [`CREATURE_ATTACK_SECONDS`], [`PERSON_ATTACK_SECONDS`] from the first warning, the
//!   second warning one timer after the first [hypothesis: the split; setgs of
//!   fAITrespassWarningTimer and iGuardWarnings showed no difference in `warnings2`,
//!   whose start distances varied too much to tell]. Inside half the aggro radius
//!   ([`AGGRO_ATTACK_SHARE`]) the attack comes at once [observed: the young gecko at
//!   196 and 217 of 500 at once; the guard at 32 and 62 of 128 after about 3 s]. Open: the
//!   cash-room guard warned at 98-121 units (inside his 128) and never attacked in 68 s,
//!   while the geckos at 0.78 of their radius did; not built.
//! - **Guard packages do not warn** [observed: `warnings2` g_room*, Gomorrah's room
//!   guards on vGomorrahGuardPackage, with no aggro radius of their own, neither warned
//!   nor fought a player 15 units from the door each guards or 60 units from them;
//!   their package allows warnings (no "No Warn/Attack Behavior")]. The wiki's Guard
//!   package summary ("warn intruders near the guarded reference", packages.md section 3)
//!   is not built: a guard's GuardTrespass lines come with an aggro radius, as the
//!   cash-room guard's did. Built on 2026-10-24, taken out on 2026-10-25.
//! - **Who**: the player only [design: other actors' aggro radii are not measured];
//!   never an actor that is the player's ally or friend or teammate, one already hostile
//!   by its records, a dead, unconscious or restrained one.
//!
//! Example (FalloutNV.esm): the "Young Gecko Hunter" geckos of GS02
//! (VSpawnSpecialTier1GeckoSmallGS02Hunter 0x00165183) are Unaggressive, neutral to the
//! player, with Aggro Radius Behavior on and a radius of 650 [observed: `fnvtool esm
//! decode`]: they ignore the player at a distance and attack within 650 units.
