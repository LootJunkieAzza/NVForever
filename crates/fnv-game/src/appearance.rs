//! AgeRace and SexChange: an actor's race or sex changed by a script
//! (docs/spec-notes/appearance-changes.md).
//!
//! - **AgeRace n** moves the actor `n` steps along its race's age links: each step up to
//!   the race's older race (RACE ONAM), each step down to its younger one (YNAM); a step
//!   past the end of the chain is not taken (it clamps at the oldest or youngest)
//!   [documented: GECK wiki AgeRace, catalogue notes; xEdit RACE "Older", "Younger"]. A
//!   race without links (Ghoul) does not change [documented: "only races with linked age
//!   variants are affected"]. The masters' links are symmetric for the four playable
//!   races (adult ↔ child, adult ↔ old) [observed: FalloutNV.esm RACE records], so the
//!   opening's `player.AgeRace -1` then `player.AgeRace 1` (VCG00 stage 5) leaves the
//!   player's race as it was [observed: the stage's result script].
//! - **SexChange [sex] [reset]** gives the actor that sex, or the other one without a
//!   sex; no calling reference is the player [documented: GECK wiki SexChange]. With
//!   reset (default 0) and only on the player, and only when the sex really changes, the
//!   face becomes the race's first starting face for the new sex [documented: catalogue
//!   notes, "the default preset for that race and gender"; hypothesis: the first preset
//!   is the default]; the engine picks it (`AppearanceChange::reset`), as the character
//!   creator does when its sex is changed (the opening's VCG01 asks the player's sex with
//!   reset 1 [observed: VCG01SCRIPT]).
//! - **Kept**: on an NPC the change is kept on the reference (`RefExtra::race`,
//!   `RefExtra::female`), so saves keep it; on the player in the character creator's look
//!   (`PlayerState::look`), or before the creator in `PlayerState::race` and
//!   `PlayerState::female`. GetIsRace, GetIsSex, GetPCIsSex, IsChild and the race's
//!   abilities read the changed values.
//! - **Drawn anew**: each change is told to the engine ([`Game::take_appearance_changes`]),
//!   which draws the actor again from its record with the new race and sex: the new
//!   race's head, body and default face textures [documented: AgeRace notes, "the actor
//!   takes the default face textures of the new race"], and the race's default hair when
//!   its hair is not one the new race or sex may have [documented: SexChange notes, "an
//!   NPC whose hair is invalid for the new sex gets the default hair"; AgeRace notes,
//!   "invalid hair falls back to default"]. The player's hair is kept [hypothesis: the
//!   original restores it on the way back, "restored on return for the player only"].
//! - **MatchFaceGeometry source percent** (Fallout 3's; Tale of Two Wastelands calls it
//!   on Dad in Vault101ExitScript and CG04 stage 65, `MatchFaceGeometry player
//!   CGMatchFace`) morphs the actor's face geometry `percent` (0–100) of the way from
//!   its current face to `source`'s; 100 is the same face; the face texture is not
//!   changed [documented: GECK wiki MatchFaceGeometry and its notes]. The geometry is
//!   the FaceGen shape coefficients, symmetric (FGGS) and asymmetric (FGGA)
//!   [documented: xEdit wbFaceGen]; each moves in a straight line towards the source's
//!   [hypothesis: "a 50% morph from his current face" read as a weighted mean of the
//!   coefficients]. An NPC keeps its calls in order ([`FaceMatch`], `RefExtra::
//!   face_matches`, saved) and is drawn again; the engine applies them to the record's
//!   coefficients as it draws the head (`nvforever` actors.rs). A source the game holds
//!   the face of (the player, once the character creator has given a look) has its
//!   coefficients kept with the call, so the face matched is the one it had then; any
//!   other source's is read from its record when drawn [design]. On the player the
//!   creator's look itself is changed, which needs both faces known.
