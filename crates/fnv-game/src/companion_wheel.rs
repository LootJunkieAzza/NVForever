//! The companion wheel and the companion behaviour it sets (docs/spec-notes/companion-wheel.md).
//!
//! - **When it opens**: the player activates a teammate (SetPlayerTeammate 1) that would be
//!   talked to: the wheel opens instead of the conversation [documented: GECK wiki
//!   SetPlayerTeammate, "Enables the Companion Wheel (New Vegas)"]. While it is open it is
//!   the open menu, [`MENU_CODE`] (MenuMode 1075) [hypothesis: the code], and the game is
//!   held behind it like behind the other menus.
//! - **What its buttons do**: each command but Talk, Use StimPak and Back Up makes the
//!   companion say the matching topic of the quest VNPCFollowers ([`Command::topic`]), and
//!   the line's result scripts do the work: `Waiting`, `IsFollowingLong`,
//!   `IsFollowingDefault`, `FollowerSwitchAggressive`, `CombatStyleRanged` /
//!   `CombatStyleMelee` with SetCombatStyle, EvaluatePackage, OpenTeammateContainer, and
//!   the quest's own bookkeeping (`fFollowerWaitingLeaveDay`) [observed: FalloutNV.esm,
//!   the lines of FollowersWait, FollowersLetsGo, FollowersTactics…; hypothesis: that the
//!   wheel says those topics rather than setting the variables itself]. The line goes on
//!   in real time while the wheel is open ([`Game::update_wheel_line`]): its end script
//!   (FollowersLetsGo's `Waiting 0` is in its end script) runs when it is over.
//! - **What the variables then do**: `Waiting` and `IsFollowingLong` choose the companion's
//!   Wait (Guard) or Follow package by the packages' own conditions [observed:
//!   FollowersBooneFollowPlayerWAIT/LONG/DEFAULT]; the combat style's Melee Only / Ranged
//!   Only restriction is the combat AI's [observed: FollowersCombatStyleMelee and
//!   FollowersCombatStyleRanged]; `FollowerSwitchAggressive` is read here
//!   ([`Game::is_passive_teammate`], `Game::would_attack`): a passive companion fights only
//!   who fights the player or a teammate, or has hit it [hypothesis].
//! - **Use StimPak**: one of the player's stimpaks is used on the companion
//!   (`Game::ingest`) and it says Regenerating [documented: GECK wiki Combat dialogue,
//!   "Regenerating: Said by actor given a stimpak at the companion wheel"].
//! - **Back Up**: the companion steps back from the player ([`BACK_UP`] units), walked by
//!   `fnv_ai` ([`Game::take_back_up`]) [hypothesis: the distance].
//! - **Sneaking**: a teammate following the player sneaks while the player sneaks
//!   [documented: GECK wiki SetPlayerTeammate, "The teammate will imitate the player's
//!   sneak state"] (`Game::sneaks`); as it starts it says FollowersStealthing
//!   [hypothesis: when the topic is said].
