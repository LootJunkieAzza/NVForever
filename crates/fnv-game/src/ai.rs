//! AI package choice (Layer 6): which package of its list an actor runs, and when it
//! chooses again. Facts and their sources: docs/spec-notes/packages.md §3 (documented)
//! and §4 (observed in the game); the design: docs/design/actor-behaviour.md.
//!
//! - An actor's packages are tried top to bottom; the first valid one runs
//!   ([`Game::select_package`], [`Game::check_package`]).
//! - A script choosing again (`EvaluatePackage`) is [`Game::evaluate_package`]; the
//!   game's own periodic choice is [`Game::update_package`], which lets a Must Complete
//!   package finish first ([`Game::package_goal_met`]).
//! - With [`crate::game::GameConfig::package_interval`] set, [`Game::tick`] makes the
//!   periodic choice for the actors around the player and runs the packages' begin,
//!   end and change scripts. What a package then does (travel, sandbox, …) is the next
//!   layer's work.
