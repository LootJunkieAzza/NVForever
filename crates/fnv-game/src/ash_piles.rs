//! Ash and goo piles (docs/spec-notes/ash-piles.md): what an energy weapon's critical
//! kill leaves of the body.
//!
//! - A weapon's critical effect (WEAP CRDT: an actor effect and the On Death flag) is
//!   applied to the one hit by a critical hit; with On Death only when that hit kills
//!   ([`Game::apply_crit_effect`]; §1).
//! - The shipped critical effects that disintegrate (the laser's and the alien
//!   weapons' Disintegration, the plasma weapons' Gooification) are Script effects whose
//!   scripts do the rest: SetCriticalStage …Start, the effect shaders, then
//!   `AttachAshPile` and SetCriticalStage …End, which culls the body
//!   (`functions::objects::set_critical_stage`; §2).
//! - `AttachAshPile [type]` places the pile activator at the actor ([`Game::attach_ash_pile`]);
//!   activating the pile opens the dead actor's inventory (the engine's activation,
//!   [`Game::ash_pile_source`]; §3).
