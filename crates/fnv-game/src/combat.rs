//! Combat's consequences in the game world (docs/design/combat.md §5.3 step 5, step C5):
//! health, hits, death and kill XP, through the same actor values, flags and script
//! events the scripts see (`functions::actor`). The damage itself is `fnv-combat`'s;
//! this module applies it.
//!
//! - **Level** [documented: GECK wiki Stats Tab pages]: ACBS level, or with "PC Level
//!   Mult" the player's level × the multiplier, kept within the calculated minimum and
//!   maximum (a maximum of 0 is none).
//! - **Maximum health** (the base of Health, code 16; `crate::actor_values` has the
//!   other values), from permanent Endurance:
//!   - player: `fAVDHealthEnduranceOffset` + Endurance × `fAVDHealthEnduranceMult` +
//!     (level − 1) × `fAVDHealthLevelMult` + its NPC_ Base Health;
//!   - NPC: Base Health + (Endurance − 1) × `fAVDNPCHealthEnduranceMult`, plus (level
//!     − 1) × `fAVDNPCHealthLevelMult` when its stats are auto-calculated ("Auto-calc
//!     stats"); a hand-set NPC's level adds nothing;
//!   - creature: its DATA Health.
//!
//!   [documented: the settings' names and values are in the masters, combat-data.md §3,
//!   and the Stats Tab pages say NPC health derives from Endurance and level plus Base
//!   Health; observed: the NPC form fits all fifteen NPCs the AI observer saw at full
//!   Health in the original (auto-calculated: the NCR troopers 50, Fiends 65 to 105,
//!   Joe Cobb, Sunny Smiles, Ringo, settlers, the Strip crowd, Violet 170; hand-set:
//!   Cook-Cook 215 at level 14, Doc Mitchell, Trudy, the Geckoman, Ramos),
//!   npc-behaviour-compare.md §9; hypothesis: the player's form, to be settled by
//!   capture.] A template with the "Stats" flag supplies the stats when it is an NPC_ or
//!   CREA.
//! - **A hit** lowers Health's damage part (as `DamageActorValue`), remembers the hit
//!   (location, critical, attacker, weapon) and runs the target's OnHit (the attacker as
//!   subject) and OnHitWith (the weapon) blocks [documented: block names, catalogue;
//!   hypothesis: their order].
//! - **Limb damage** (step C8): a hit on a body part lowers that part's condition actor
//!   value (25–31, starting at 100) by the limb damage as a share of the part's pool, the
//!   part's health percentage of the actor's maximum health: `loss = limb damage ÷
//!   (max health × percent ÷ 100) × 100`. The limb is crippled when its condition
//!   reaches 0 [documented: GECK wiki Body Part Data, crippled after that percentage of
//!   total health; hypothesis: the count-down form]. Conditions stop at 0.
//! - **No damage** for actors of a race with the Child flag [documented: GECK wiki Race]
//!   or creatures flagged Invulnerable [documented: xEdit flag name].
//! - **Essential** actors (base flag, `SetEssential` or `SetActorRefEssential`) are not
//!   killed: at zero health they are knocked out and keep 1 health, and get up later
//!   (`crate::unconscious`, docs/spec-notes/unconscious.md) [documented: the flag and
//!   KillActor's notes; design: what stays undone].
//! - **Death** at zero health: as `KillActor` (dead flag, killer, GetDeadCount, OnDeath).
//! - **Kill XP** for the player [documented: GECK wiki Experience Settings]: the target's
//!   level picks its difficulty (the first `iXPLevelKill<NPC|Creature><Class>` at or above
//!   it, very hard beyond); the reward is that class's `iXPRewardKill<NPC|Opponent>
//!   <Class>`; none when others did more than `100 − iXPDeathRewardHealthThreshold` % of
//!   the damage.
