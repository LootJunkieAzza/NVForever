//! Sleeping and waiting as scripts see and ask for them (docs/spec-notes/wait-menu.md
//! §5, §8 and §9). The Sleep / Wait menu itself is the engine's: it tells the game when
//! accepted hours start and stop passing ([`Rest::begin`], [`Rest::end`]) and takes what
//! scripts asked for ([`Rest::take_requests`]).
//!
//! Functions: `IsPCSleeping`, `IsTimePassing`, `SetPCSleepHours`, `WakeUpPC`,
//! `ShowSleepWaitMenu`. `GetPCSleepHours` has no opcode in the catalogue (no script or
//! condition of the game's plugins calls it), so it is not registered; its value is
//! [`Rest::sleep_hours`].
//!
//! Also here: who counts as a hostile actor near the player, and whose bed the player
//! may sleep in, for the menu's refusals (§9). Neither rule is sourced; each says so.
