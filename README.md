# NVForever

An open-source, clean-room reimplementation of the **Fallout: New Vegas** engine, in the
spirit of OpenMW. It runs on the data files of *your own copy* of the game; it ships no
Bethesda content and contains no Bethesda or Gamebryo code.

NVForever is not affiliated with or endorsed by Bethesda Softworks, ZeniMax Media,
Microsoft or Obsidian Entertainment. See [LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md).

## Getting started

1. Own and install *Fallout: New Vegas* (base game; DLC optional).
2. Download a build from the [releases page](https://github.com/LootJunkieAzza/NVForever/releases)
   and unpack it **outside** the game folder.
3. Run `nvforever.exe` (or `./nvforever.sh` on Linux) and point it at your game folder
   when asked.

NVForever never writes into the game folder. Its settings, saves and logs live in
`Documents\My Games\NVForever`.

## Mods

- **Mod Organizer 2:** add `nvforever.exe` to MO2's executables (the drop-down beside
  **Run**, then **<Edit…>**) and start it from there. It loads the plugins ticked in MO2,
  in MO2's order, and the game folder MO2 manages. See
  [docs/mod-organizer-2.md](docs/mod-organizer-2.md).
- **Without a mod manager:** put the mod in the game's `Data` folder, then turn its plugin
  on in `Documents\My Games\NVForever\plugins.txt` with a `*` in front of its line. The
  order of the lines is the load order. NVForever keeps its own list, so the original
  game's mod list is not changed.

Mods that need NVSE may not work yet: NVSE plugins (`.dll`) do not run in NVForever.

## Building from source

Needs [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and Python 3.11+.

```bash
cd engine
cargo run --release --bin nvforever -- --data "<path to Fallout New Vegas>/Data"
```
